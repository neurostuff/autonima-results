<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Background 
  
Working memory (WM) deficits are a key feature of schizophrenia and are also seen in unaffected siblings. These deficits might arise  from disrupted transitions from one brain state to another. Using a robust algorithm called the Bayesian Switching Dynamical System (BSDS), we studied hidden brain states and their transitions during a WM task in people with schizophrenia. 


## Methods 
  
We used BSDS to identify brain states based on regions of interest (ROIs) within the default mode network and the frontoparietal network in 161 patients with schizophrenia, 37 unaffected siblings, and 96 healthy controls during N-back (0, 2, and resting fixation) tasks. We estimated group differences in the properties of brain states and studied the influence of WM performance and clinical characteristics on them using General Linear Models. 


## Results 
  
We identified 4 brain states underlying the WM task: high-demand, low-demand, fixation, and non-dominant states. Compared with controls and siblings, patients showed reduced occupancy and lifetime of high-demand state during the “2-back,” reduced lifetime of low-demand state during the “0-back,” but increased occupancy and lifetime of fixation state during both task periods. Aberrant high-demand state mediated the association between WM performance and negative symptoms. Compared with controls and patients, siblings showed increased occupancy of high-demand and reduced fixation state during the resting fixation condition; this putative compensatory process correlated with better WM performance. 


## Conclusions 
  
Latent brain states of intrinsic connectivity that represent internal mental processes affect WM performance, influencing the expression of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and cognitive resilience in unaffected siblings.

## Background 
  
Working memory (WM) is one of the most consistently affected cognitive domains in schizophrenia [ ]. WM deficit often appears before disease onset [ ]; it is also observed in unaffected siblings of patients [ ], who share the genetic liability with patients [ ], while being free from the potential impact of chronic illness and antipsychotic medications on cognition. Thus, WM deficit is seen as an endophenotype of schizophrenia [ ]; understanding its neural mechanisms could provide deeper insights into the pathophysiology of this illness.
 

The neural architecture of WM relies on the dynamic organization of distributed large-scale brain networks, particularly the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and the default mode network (DMN) [ ]. WM deficits in schizophrenia are often attributed to disrupted functional connectivity [ ], FPN hypoactivity [ ], and DMN hyperactivity [ ,  ] during task execution. However, recent findings suggest that conclusions based on static connectivity status may be overly simplistic. Brain states are dynamic, exhibiting complex and systematic changes when handling varying cognitive loads and transitioning between load levels [ – ]. 

Individuals with schizophrenia display abnormal brain network dynamics during task execution; this includes unstable activity [ ], disorganized states of connectivity [ – ], and inappropriately enhanced network flexibility [ ] (also seen in unaffected siblings [ ] to a lesser extent). These observations on network dynamics have been predominantly derived using a sliding-window or a clustering approach. Both methods face notable limitations. Sliding-window analysis requires an arbitrary definition of window width, i.e., the time interval within which neural dynamic states are estimated. Without strong priors, researchers have a high degree of freedom, and this heavily influence outcomes [ ,  ]. Clustering techniques require prior knowledge of the expected number of brain states, introducing potential bias that affects the evaluation of transitions and connectivity patterns [ ]. These arbitrary choices may introduce unknown but systematic differences among patients and controls. Furthermore, the above methods identify network states directly from the observed Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) data, rather than by explicitly modeling underlying neural processes [ ]. This is particularly important during task processing, where both the task demands and latent brain states can influence an individual’s performance [ ]. 

To address these challenges, a Bayesian Switching Dynamic System (BSDS) approach has been recently proposed. This unsupervised learning approach identifies brain states in large-scale functional brain networks [ ]. BSDS models network organization as a sequence of short-lived but latent neural states at each time point, characterized by distinct spatial patterns of activation and inter-regional connectivity [ ]. The occupancy rate (i.e., how dominant is a state during a period of interest), the mean lifetime (the persistence of a state once it occurs), and transition probabilities (i.e., the likelihood of moving between states) offer insights into the state-space dynamics of brain networks [ – ]. Previous studies have identified distinct coordination patterns among 2 major large-scale networks — the FPN and DMN, forming multiple latent brain states. The dominant brain state during a WM task has predictive value for task engagement, underscoring its stability and broad applicability [ ,  ]. However, the application of these findings to schizophrenia remains limited. To date, no studies have examined how the dynamic states generated within the FPN and DMN influence WM processing in patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings. 

We address this gap by employing BSDS to identify the differences in dynamic brain states (i.e., occupancy rate, mean lifetime, and state transition probabilities) within the FPN and DMN during a WM task in patients with schizophrenia, their unaffected siblings, and healthy controls. We classify brain states as dominant or nondominant during each cognitive load based on occupancy rate and mean lifetime. We expected to see a predominance of states representing absent/low task demands in patients and siblings, conferring a cognitive disadvantage even when external task demands are high. If this is the case, then intrinsic brain states can be considered a viable target for improving cognitive performance in schizophrenia. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
All participants were right-handed native Chinese speakers and signed written informed consent to participate in this study. The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. All procedures were approved by the medical ethics committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Detailed recruitment information was provided in Additional file 1: S1. Although we have not made too many restrictions on the age of onset and the course of the disease, it is worth noting that this cohort is indeed mainly composed of early-onset first-episode schizophrenia. The cohort has been reported in our previous work [ ]. 

Demographic and clinical information of this study cohort are presented in Table  . Patients with schizophrenia (SZs) were younger than unaffected siblings (SBs) (  p   < 0.001) and healthy controls (HCs) (  p   < 0.001), reducing the likelihood of affected but undiagnosed siblings being included. Besides, there was a “ladder” pattern of the education received in years among the groups (  F   = 28.161,   p   < 0.001; HCs > SBs:   p   = 0.030; HCs > SZs:   p   < 0.001; SBs > SZs:   p   = 0.042). In terms of WM task performance, the HCs performed better than the SZs at both the “0-back” (  p   < 0.001) and “2-back” (  p   < 0.001) loads, while the difference between the sibling group and the other two groups was not significant, except for siblings performing better than the patient group during the “0-back” load (  p   = 0.031).

### MRI data acquisition and preprocessing 
  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired using a Siemens Allegra 3-T scanner. Data preprocessing was conducted on the DPABI toolbox [ ]. Detailed scanning parameters and preprocessing procedures are provided in the Additional file 1: S2. 

The final analysis cohort comprised 161 SZs, 37 SBs, and 96 HCs. No significant differences were observed in the overall count of interpolated displaced volumes between the patient group and the control group (mean ± standard deviation; SZs = 10.9 ± 15.2, SBs = 9.9 ± 13.7, HCs = 10.1 ± 14.1,   p   = 0.661). 


### Working memory task paradigm 
  
We adopted the n-back task as the WM paradigm, and the “0-back” and “2-back” loads were applied in our research. Subjects pressed a button once when they saw the letter “x” in the “0-back” condition; in the “2-back” condition, subjects pressed a button once when the letter presented was the same as two letters prior. A detailed description of this paradigm is given in Additional file 1: S3 and Fig. S1. 


### ROI selection 
  
In line with a previous study that employed the BSDS approach in healthy individuals [ ], the ROIs were selected based on meta-analytic results from the Neurosynth platform, using the terms “working memory and default mode network” and “working memory and frontal parietal network” as the search criterion. A total of 12 ROIs were included in this work: 6 ROIs within the FPN, including the bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC_L, DLPFC_R), the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG_L, IFG_R), and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL_L, IPL_R), and 6 ROIs in the DMN, including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the bilateral angular gyrus (AG_L, AG_R), and the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG_L, PHG_R)[ ]. The MNI coordinates of all ROIs were provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. 


### BSDS model 
  
The BSDS model assumes that the ROI time series can be represented as a finite number of states that repeat or switch over time, with each state modeled by a multivariate Gaussian distribution parameterized by a mean vector and a covariance matrix. Unlike previous studies that directly apply hidden Markov models (HMM) to observed electrophysiological or fMRI data, this approach applies HMM to the latent space variables of the observed data [ ,  ]. In this framework, observed fMRI data are modeled using a probabilistic factor analysis approach, where a series of latent space variables is generated by an autoregressive process. A first-order Markov chain, implemented through an HMM, is then applied to these latent variables. Bayesian inference is employed to estimate the posterior distributions of all model parameters, combining prior knowledge with observed data using Bayes'theorem. To handle the parametric Bayesian formulation of BSDS, variational inference is utilized for both parameter learning and latent variable inference. Calculation of BSDS referred to prior works [ ,  ] and detailed information was provided in Additional file 1: S4. 

The normalized BOLD time courses for each ROI were temporally concatenated across all conditions (including fixation condition, “0-back” load, and “2-back” load) and all subjects (including SZs, SBs, and HCs). The three groups were analyzed together using the BSDS model, which improves model fitting due to constraints inherent to BSDS and avoids the need to match brain states across separate models. Applying the BSDS model to these time courses provided insights into the temporal evolution of states, including occupancy rates, mean lifetimes of states, transition probability matrices, and the mean and covariance of states. The occupancy rate represents the proportion of time spent in a particular state, while the mean lifetime indicates the average duration a state persists during each visit. The transition probability matrix describes the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another. The BSDS process was repeated 10 times, and the best model—defined as the one achieving the highest lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data—was selected for further analysis (see Fig.  ).   
Overall analysis approach.   A   Defined 12 ROIs of FPN and DMN and extracted ROIs time series of each subject.   B   Preprocessed time series using BSDS model.   C   Developed temporal evolution of states from BSDS model.   D   Extracted the dynamic properties of states: occupancy rate, mean lifetime, and transition probabilities of states.   E   Detected group differences between SZs, SBs, and HCs.   F   Detected correlation between dynamic properties, neurocognitive functions, working memory performance, and clinical characteristics.

### Statistical analysis 
  
We utilized SPSS statistical software (version 22) to compare demographic and clinical characteristics and WM task performance across groups. Differences in age, years of education, accuracy, and response time under the “0-back” and “2-back” loads were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Sex differences were assessed using   χ  2 tests. 

We calculated properties of the BSDS model and then utilized SPSS for the following comparison analysis. To control for potential confounding factors, we regressed out the influence of age, gender, years of education, and framewise displacement on the properties of each brain state. 

We used   F  -tests and post hoc Tukey tests to examine group differences in the properties of each condition. Then, we performed correlation analyses to investigate whether the occupancy and mean lifetime of each state correlated with neurocognitive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Chinese Revised [WAIS-CR] information, WAIS-CR digit symbol), WM performance, and clinical characteristics (illness duration, antipsychotic dosage, scores of Scales for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms [SAPS] and Scales for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]). We also explored the mediating effect of properties of brain states in the correlation among neurocognitive function, WM performance, and clinical characteristics. We corrected multi-comparison and correlation analysis data using Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction at   p   < 0.05 [ ]. 



## Results 
  
### BSDS characteristics 
  
Across the WM task, BSDS from the FPN and DMN identified a total of 4 brain states. State 1 reflected decreased activity in ROIs within the DMN and increased activity in ROIs within the FPN. States 2–4 reflected increased activity in ROIs within the DMN and decreased activity in ROIs within the FPN. Among them, states 3 and 4 showed relatively higher activity in the vmPFC and lower activity in the PHG compared to state 2. The distribution of occupancy (  F   = 257.930,   p-fdr   < 0.001) and mean lifetime (  F   = 131.363,   p-fdr   < 0.001) of each brain state were different from each other. Post hoc tests showed that state 2 had the lowest occupancy and mean lifetime compared to the other 3 states. States 3 and 4 had the highest occupancy, while the mean lifetime of state 4 was lower than that of state 3 in the whole sample (see Table  ).

Further analysis considering task conditions showed that, during the fixation condition, state 3 had the highest occupancy and mean lifetime, while state 2 had the lowest occupancy and mean lifetime; during the “0-back” load, state 2 had the lowest occupancy and mean lifetime, while states 4 and 3 had the highest occupancy and mean lifetime, respectively; during the “2-back” load, state 1 had the highest occupancy and mean lifetime, while state 2 had the lowest occupancy and mean lifetime. Given the dominant distribution of each state in each condition, we referred to states 1, 4, and 3 as the high-demand state (SH), the low-demand state (SL), and the fixation state (SF). State 2 (with higher PHG activity than SL and SF) was designated as a nondominant state (SN) (see Fig.  A,   and Table  ).

To rule out the potential effects of benzodiazepine use and head motion on BSDS properties, we repeated the analyses in two subsamples: one excluding participants with any history of benzodiazepine use and another limited to those with a mean framewise displacement < 0.2 mm. No substantial changes were observed between the newly generated and the above-reported results (see Additional file 1: Table S2 and Table S3). 


### Group differences in occupancy and mean lifetime of WM-related brain states 
  
We investigated group differences in the properties of dynamic brain states associated with WM among SZs, SBs, and HCs.   F  -tests and post hoc   t  -tests were conducted to investigate the group differences in the occupancy rate and mean lifetime. 

During the fixation condition, group-related differences were detected in occupancy (SH:   F   = 7.362,   p-fdr   = 0.008; SF:   F   = 4.535,   p-fdr   = 0.044) of SH and SF. Higher occupancy of SH and lower occupancy of SF in SBs compared to both HCs (SH:   t   = 3.523,   p   = 0.001; SF:   t   = − 2.916,   p   = 0.004) and SZs (SH:   t   = 2.734,   p   = 0.007; SF:   t   = − 3.776,   p   < 0.001) were responsible for these group differences. 

During the ‘0-back” load, no significant group difference was detected after FDR correction. 

During the “2-back” load, group differences were detected in occupancy (  F   = 12.542,   p-fdr   < 0.001) and mean lifetime (  F   = 9.288,   p-fdr   < 0.001) of SH and occupancy (  F   = 8.358,   p-fdr   < 0.001) of SF. Lower occupancy and mean lifetime of SH, and higher occupancy of SF in SZs compared to both HCs (SH, occupancy:   t   = − 4.715,   p   < 0.001; SH, mean lifetime:   t   = − 3.701,   p   < 0.001; SF, occupancy:   t   = 3.028,   p   = 0.003) and SBs (SH, occupancy:   t   = − 2.957,   p   = 0.003; SH, mean lifetime:   t   = − 2.502,   p   = 0.016; SF, occupancy:   t   = 3.972,   p   < 0.001) were responsible for these group differences (see Fig.  C and Table  ).

We also repeated the above analysis in two subsamples: one excluding participants with any history of benzodiazepine use and another limited to those with a mean framewise displacement < 0.2 mm. No substantial changes were observed between the newly generated and the above-reported results (see Additional file 1: Table S4 and TableS5). 


### Group differences in transition probabilities among WM-related brain states 
  
During the “0-back” load, transition probabilities from SN to SN (  F   = 5.863,   p-fdr   = 0.016), SN to SF (  F   = 6.233,   p-fdr   = 0.016), and SF to SF (  F   = 7.610,   p-fdr   = 0.016) showed significant group differences. The group differences during the “0-back” load primarily resulted from distinct transition probabilities in SZs. SZs had higher transition probabilities from SN to SN compared to HCs (  p   = 0.004) and from SF to SF compared to HCs (  p   = 0.003) and SBs (  p   = 0.012). SZs also showed decreased transition probabilities from SN to SF (  p   = 0.001) compared to HCs. 

During the “2-back” load, transition probabilities from SN to SF (  F   = 8.155,   p-fdr   < 0.001) showed significant group differences, which primarily resulted from decreased transition probabilities from SN to SF in SZs compared to those in HCs (  p   < 0.001). Detailed information is provided in Fig.  D. 


### Correlation analysis 
  
We further conducted correlation analyses between properties of dynamic brain states and neurocognitive functions, WM performance, and clinical characteristics. Detailed information is provided in Table  .

During the ‘0-back’ load, we observed a significant positive correlation between neurocognitive functions (WAIS-CR information [occupancy:   r   = 0.252,   p-fdr   = 0.043; mean lifetime:   r   = 0.246,   p-fdr   = 0.043] and accuracy of “0-back” load [occupancy:   r   = 0.262,   p-fdr   = 0.043; mean lifetime:   r   = 0.249,   p-fdr   = 0.043]) and occupancy and mean lifetime of SL in SZs. Occupancy of SH was reduced in those with higher SANS scores (  r   = − 0.232,   p-fdr   = 0.043) in SZs, primarily from affective flattening, avolition-apathy, and anhedonia-asociality (see Additional file 1: Fig. S2 and Table S6). 

For the “2-back” load, we observed neurocognitive functions (WAIS-CR information and accuracy of “2-back” load) being positively correlated with occupancy (WAIS-CR information:   r   = 0.231,   p-fdr   = 0.041; accuracy of “2-back” load:   r   = 0.380,   p-fdr   < 0.001) and mean lifetime (accuracy of “2-back” load:   r   = 0.278,   p-fdr   = 0.012) of high-demand state, and being negatively correlated with occupancy (WAIS-CR information:   r   = − 0.219,   p-fdr   = 0.043; accuracy of “2-back” load:   r   = − 0.292,   p-fdr   = 0.012) and mean lifetime (accuracy of “2-back” load:   r   = − 0.295,   p-fdr   < 0.001) of SF and occupancy (accuracy of “2-back” load:   r   = − 0.233,   p-fdr   = 0.043) of non-dominant state in schizophrenia. Besides, patients with higher SANS scores (all items) had lower occupancy of high-demand state (  r   = − 0.258,   p-fdr   = 0.012) but higher occupancy of fixation state (  r   = 0.251,   p-fdr   = 0.012) (see Fig.  A and Additional file 1: Table S6). No significant correlation was observed between transition properties of brain states and cognitive or clinical characteristics in schizophrenia (see Additional file 1: Table S7). We also performed a permutation test with 10,000 iterations, which validated the robustness of our correlation analysis (see Additional file 1: Table S8).

We also investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and BSDS properties in siblings during the fixation condition, focusing on the unique occupancy of SH and SF in this group. We found that lower occupancy of SF during the fixation condition was associated with greater accuracy during both the “0-back” (  r   = − 0.376,   p   = 0.024) and “2-back” (  r   = − 0.450,   p   = 0.006) loads. However, these correlations did not remain significant after FDR correction (see Additional file 1: Table S9). 


### Mediation analysis 
  
Given the correlation between occupancy of SH and SF, WM performance, and SANS scores, we conducted a mediation analysis to further explore the underlying interaction among these factors. We observed that occupancy of SH negatively mediated the relationship between SANS scores and accuracy of “2-back” load (  = − 0.0015,   p   = 0.04) (see Fig.  B), indicating that the detrimental effect of negative symptoms on cognition can be reduced if we can “increase” the occurrence of high-demand state. 



## Discussion 
  
Using the BSDS model to characterize the dynamic intrinsic brain states during WM tasks in schizophrenia, we report several key findings. Firstly, irrespective of diagnostic status, 4 brain states constitute the coordinated dynamics between DMN and FPN during WM tasks. A distinctly dominant state is seen during each aspect of task performance: the high WM load (SH), the low WM load (SL), and the fixation condition (SF), with a fourth, less specific, non-dominant state (SN). Second, a predominance of states representing absent/low task demands (SF) but a diminution of load-appropriate states (SH in 2-back and SL in 0-back) is seen in patients. SBs showed a relative predominance of SH but reduced SF during the fixation condition compared with HCs and SZs, indicating that task-inappropriate states occur in siblings as well. Third, SZs showed different transition probabilities from SN to SN and SF and from SF to SF compared to HCs and SBs, reflecting a state-shifting instability specific to patients. Fourth, higher occupancy and mean lifetime of SH and SL during the corresponding loads, and lower occupancy and mean lifetime of SF correlated with better neurocognitive functions and less severity of negative symptoms, indicating that the task-appropriate occurrence of brain states is critical for better cognitive health and a lower symptom burden in schizophrenia. 

Using the BSDS method, we identified 4 potential brain functional states across 3 conditions for 3 groups. Among these, the SH state dominates under high cognitive demand conditions, characterized by decreased activity in the DMN and increased activity in the FPN, aligning with prior findings on brain network activity changes during WM tasks[ ,  ]. In contrast, under low cognitive demand and fixation conditions, the SL and SF states, characterized by elevated DMN activity and reduced FPN activity, were predominant. While these brain states persisted across different conditions, the dominant state varied for each condition. Specifically, SF and SL were dominant throughout most of the scanning process, particularly during the fixation condition and the “0-back” load, whereas SH was transiently dominant during the “2-back” load. The total distribution of each state is generally similar to prior works utilizing the BSDS model [ ,  ]. 

Although the distribution patterns of brain states were similar across conditions for the groups, significant inter-group differences emerged in the occupancy and mean lifetime of each state. During WM tasks, these differences were primarily driven by SZs. Compared to SBs and HCs, SZs had lower occupancy and mean lifetime of SH during the ‘2-back” load, and relatively lower mean lifetime of SL during the “0-back” load. SH and SL were considered the prominent states in high-demand conditions and low-demand conditions, respectively. These findings suggest an inappropriate allocation of brain states in SZs during WM tasks. SZs exhibited reduced engagement and maintenance of brain states associated with cognitive demands and increased involvement of states linked to fixation, particularly under high cognitive demands. Disability in neural resource engagement to meet cognitive demand seems to be an important neural mechanism of WM deficit in schizophrenia [ ,  ], and our finding might provide new evidence for this opinion. Besides, less SH means less duration of DMN suppression during WM tasks, resulting in elevated average DMN activity throughout the task. This might explain the failure of SZs to suppress DMN activity during WM tasks, a phenomenon repeatedly reported in previous works [ ,  ,  ]. 

Interestingly, SBs had the lowest occupancy and mean lifetime of SF in each condition, especially in the fixation condition, with relatively higher occupancy and mean lifetime of SL, though the group difference was usually not significant. This observation might suggest that SBs tend to keep a more active or task-demand brain state while facing the coming cognitive demand or task execution. Our previous work also found that SBs tended to show a more flexible organizational pattern during WM tasks compared to both HCs and SBs, which might result from a compensatory mechanism in SBs for maintaining WM performance [ ]. An interesting finding was that lower occupancy of SF during the fixation condition in SBs correlated with better WM performance in higher WM loads, which may suggest that SBs tended to allocate more neural resources to other brain states (SH or SL) for the preparation of following tasks. 

Additionally, we found that SZs displayed altered transitions between brain states compared to the other groups. During WM tasks, SZs were more likely to remain in SN and less likely to transition to SF compared to HCs. Moreover, SZs showed a significantly higher probability of remaining in SF, a state prominent during fixation. The predominance of non-cognitive-related states during cognitive tasks suggests that SZs struggle to redistribute brain resources dynamically to meet cognitive demands. For SBs, the only difference in transition patterns was a lower probability of maintaining SF, but this difference was not significant compared to HCs. These results showed that SBs’ dynamic brain state transitions fall between SZs and HCs, and their overall brain state occupancy and mean lifetime were closer to those of HCs, which might result from similar WM performance to HCs. However, SBs showed similar characteristics of brain states between the fixation condition and ‘0-back’ load, which resulted from higher occupancy and mean lifetime of SH during the fixation condition. This alteration suggests lower activity in DMN and higher activity in FPN compared to HCs at rest, which has been partly reported in other cohorts [ ]. Our finding suggests that SBs tend to remain in brain states associated with greater cognitive resource engagement throughout the task. This tendency may facilitate more rapid responsiveness to cognitive demands, thereby supporting their WM performance. Our previous study also demonstrated that under high WM load, SBs showed greater brain network controllability compared to both SZs and HCs—indicating a greater capacity to flexibly reach brain states required for cognitive demands [ ]. This aligns with the current findings and may represent a compensatory functional mechanism in the brains of unaffected siblings. 

We also observed a strong association between the efficiency of brain state recruitment during WM tasks and neurocognitive functions in SZs. Higher occupancy and mean lifetime of task-relevant brain states were associated with better task performance and overall cognitive function. Conversely, increased occupancy and mean lifetime of SF during fixation conditions correlated with poorer cognitive performance. These findings suggest that the cognitive deficits in SZs might stem from a predisposition toward remaining in a"fixation"state rather than transitioning to task-relevant states under cognitive demands. A potential explanation is that SZs might allocate more neural resources to keep attention during WM execution [ ,  ]. 

Previous studies have indicated that aberrant control signals during transitions between fixation and WM tasks disrupt the functional organization of DMN and FPN, potentially leading to systemic resource allocation failure [ ]. Interestingly, this study also reported that patients with more severe negative symptoms exhibited more pronounced control signal abnormalities, consistent with our findings [ ]. We observed that higher SH occupancy during WM tasks was associated with lower severity of nearly all negative symptoms in SZs. The subsequent mediation analysis further highlighted the potential impact of ‘deploying’ SH on the detrimental influence of negative symptoms on WM performance. This leads us to hypothesize that if brain states associated with high cognitive demand can be generated therapeutically, then the negative effects of WM on other domains such as emotion, attention, volition, and activity may be reduced. This is consistent with prior research on the predictive value of aberrant FPN and DMN connectivity during WM tasks for negative symptom severity [ ], and provides a potential physiological basis by which this may occur. Future studies should incorporate tasks comparing cognitive function with emotional and volitional capacities to further validate these findings. 

There are several limitations to our study. The limited size of our age-matched siblings sample may have reduced variability in this group. Nonetheless, our sample size was sufficient to identify regional group differences between SBs and HCs. We cannot fully disentangle the effects of medication and illness duration from the severity of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications were used exclusively in the SZ group; we could not eliminate this confound in group comparisons. Though we did not observe a dose-dependent effect of medication on brain state properties in SZs, the potential influence of medication cannot be entirely ruled out. Longitudinal studies, particularly involving drug-naive individuals, are necessary for definitive conclusions. Our SZ group had a lower negative symptom burden than the patients who enter clinical trials; this is explained by the early stages of their illness and the volunteering bias due to the demands from participating in the study tasks. Given the well-characterized functional dynamics of the DMN and the FPN during WM tasks, we restricted our ROI selection to nodes within these two networks. Other networks also contribute to WM tasks, such as the sensorimotor network. Including these may recover more comprehensive dynamic states. Finally, due to the limited n-back task loads used (0- and 2-back), we were unable to examine brain state properties under higher cognitive loads. 


## Conclusions 
  
Brain state dynamics during WM tasks significantly deviate from healthy patterns in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected siblings. WM performance in schizophrenia is characterized by the predominance of states associated with low task demands, and reduced engagement in high-demand states combined with aberrant transitions involving task-irrelevant states. Siblings, on the other hand, may be compensating for these intrinsic dynamics by employing high-demand states more often than needed. This raises the question if patients with schizophrenia can improve their cognitive performance by deploying high-demand states more consistently, and what therapeutic approaches can provide such gains.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is a human fMRI study in patients with schizophrenia using a task-based working memory paradigm (N-back; digit span) and real-time fMRI functional connectivity–informed neurofeedback. It employed a two-arm nonrandomized controlled experimental design with a control group, meeting the requirement for a comparison group. fMRI acquisition and task-based analyses (N‑back localizer and NF runs) are central to the methods and outcomes, and cognitive working-memory outcomes are reported. No exclusion criteria (animal study, review, non-fMRI modality, or lack of comparator) apply. Note: the control group did not undergo MRI, but a behavioral control/comparison group was present, and the study still qualifies for inclusion under the review’s criteria focusing on fMRI working-memory studies in schizophrenia.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Aim 
  
Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia shows limited improvement with pharmacotherapy, indicating a need for effective treatment. The frontoparietal network supports working memory, and a biomarker has successfully predicted performance in patients, with the left frontoparietal network contributing the most to working memory. We hypothesized that enhancing functional connectivity in this network through real‐time neurofeedback (NF) will improve working memory in patients with schizophrenia. 


## Methods 
  
We conducted a two‐arm, nonrandomized pilot study in patients with schizophrenia, with a NF group (  N   = 11) and a control N‐back training group (  N   = 11). The NF training lasted 5 days (one session per day). The first session included baseline measurements, while the next four sessions involved training. The participants completed cognitive and clinical assessments and resting‐state scans preintervention and postintervention. Our primary neural outcome was increased functional connectivity during NF, and the behavioral outcome was improvement in working memory, as indicated by scores on the digit‐span backward task and working memory capability measured by the N‐back task. 


## Results 
  
The NF group showed increased functional connectivity within the left frontoparietal network during the final session. A significant correlation existed between functional connectivity and the improvement in the mean N‐back level, indicating that enhancing this network can boost working memory. A group‐by‐time interaction effect improved postintervention task score on the digit‐span backward task in the NF group. In addition, post‐NF scans indicated an enhanced resting‐state functional connectivity within the left frontoparietal network. 


## Conclusion 
  
These results highlight the potential of functional connectivity–informed NF as a novel therapeutic approach for improving working memory in schizophrenia.

Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia occurs before onset, progresses after onset, and is a predictor of functional prognosis.  However, the current treatment for schizophrenia relies predominantly on antipsychotic medications, which have limited efficacy in the treatment of cognitive impairment.  Therefore, new treatments are required to address these shortcomings. 

Real‐time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) has been reported to improve the symptoms of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, ,   tics,  schizophrenia, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   autism spectrum disorder,  and phobia.  Biomarkers based on functional connectivity (FC) using resting‐state fMRI have been developed to predict the diagnosis and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   FC‐informed NF is a promising and novel therapeutic approach that can directly intervene in disease‐ and symptom‐specific FC derived from biomarkers. ,  ,  

FC‐informed NF (FCNef) induces changes in FC and behavioral performance. A randomized study involving two control groups of healthy participants reported persistent changes in resting‐state functional networks for 2 months after FCNef.  Another randomized study of increased or decreased FC reported behavioral changes corresponding to the direction of FC changes and changes in the resting‐state functional network in the increased FC group.  Furthermore, an FCNef study of subclinical depression targeting the FC between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and precuneus, which has been implicated as a diagnostic and symptomatic biomarker of depression,  reported improvements in Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) scores and brooding symptoms.  The FCNef approach has been successfully used to treat treatment‐resistant depression. 

Real‐time fMRI NF has been implemented for auditory hallucinations, theory of mind, and emotional cognition in schizophrenia; it reportedly controls activation in the target region and improves symptoms. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Moreover, the effectiveness of NF targeting activation of the left DLPFC for working memory in healthy participants has been reported. ,  ,  ,   However, in patients with schizophrenia, fMRI NF targeting working memory has not yet been reported. 

We aimed to use the FCNef to improve working memory in patients with schizophrenia. The frontoparietal network has been consistently reported as a neural substrate for working memory. ,  ,  ,   Our approach was based on the working memory biomarker developed by Yamashita   et al  ., ,   which is a prediction model that estimates 3‐back task performance, a measure of working memory capability, using FCs derived from resting‐state imaging in healthy participants. When applied to resting‐state scans of patients with schizophrenia, the predicted working memory capability was significantly correlated with performance on the Digit Sequencing Task of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, indicating that this biomarker could function in patients with schizophrenia. The biomarker comprised a weighted sum of 16 FC values selected from the intranetwork and internetwork connections of 18 networks identified in the study by Laird   et al  .,  with the greatest contribution (approximately 34%) from the FC within the left frontoparietal network (LFPN). Therefore, despite a notable contribution (approximately 20%) from the right frontoparietal network involving negative connectivity with the midbrain and superior parietal networks, this study focused on the LFPN because of its predominant contribution. 

Building on this, we hypothesized that enhancing FC within the LFPN through FCNef would improve working memory in patients with schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a two‐arm, nonrandomized controlled pilot study. The primary neural outcome was defined as increased LFPN FC values during FCNef, and the behavioral outcomes were improvements in working memory assessments, including the digit span backward task and the mean N‐back level. Additionally, we were particularly interested in investigating resting‐state FC changes within the LFPN because it is based on the Yamashita biomarker, which comprises resting‐state FCs. 

To our knowledge, this is the first study to use fMRI NF in Japanese patients with schizophrenia. To ensure safety as the primary objective, we collected multiple clinical and cognitive assessment measures to evaluate their effects on participants. 

## Methods 
  
### Study Structure 
  
The participants were nonrandomly assigned to the FCNef and control groups to ensure that their age compositions did not differ significantly (Fig.  ). Initially, all participants underwent adaptive N‐back training for 5 consecutive days. In‐depth preintervention training was aimed at maximizing performance gains through task repetition and minimizing learning effects during subsequent assessments. This task was also performed as a posttest and follow‐up assessment. 
  
Overview of the study.   (a)   Participants were nonrandomly assigned to the FCNef and control groups. The control group performed the Control N‐back task outside the MRI scanner. All participants initially underwent adaptive N‐back training for 5 days. The FCNef group underwent MRI, clinical, and cognitive assessments, while the control group underwent only clinical and cognitive assessments. In addition, the FCNef group had follow‐up assessments 1 to 3 months after intervention, whereas the control group did not.   (b)   The FCNef run comprised 120 s of rest, followed by six trials, with a total scan time of 8 min 32 s. Each trial consisted of rest (14 s), induction (40 s), feedback calculation (2 s), and feedback (6 s). Each session included five runs, with a total of 30 trials per session.   (c)   During the induction period, the N‐back task was performed, and a letter was presented on the screen every 4 s (stimulus: 0.5 s, interstimulus interval: 3.5 s). A feedback score was provided in the form of a green disk. The red circle represents the baseline (NF day 0 mean, score 50), and the outer green circle represents the target (NF day 0 mean plus one SD, score 100).   (d)   The LFPN‐ROI for each anatomical space was transformed into the MNI space, and the LFPN‐ROI images in the MNI space for 11 participants in the FCNef group were summed. The LFPN‐ROI included clusters in the Broca area and left insula, Wernicke area, left superior parietal lobule, and left medial frontal lobe.

We established a control group that performed the same N‐back tasks as that executed during the NF run but outside the MRI scanner. 

For preintervention and postintervention assessments, the FCNef group underwent MRI, as well as clinical and cognitive assessments, whereas the control group underwent only clinical and cognitive assessments. Furthermore, the FCNef group underwent follow‐up assessments 1 to 3 months after the intervention, whereas the control group did not. 

This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and Clinical Trials Act (Act No. 16 of April 14, 2017). The study was conducted in accordance with the protocols approved by the Kyoto University Certified Review Board (YC1251) and the Committee on Medical Ethics of Kyoto University (R2223, C1251), including the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital of Medicine, Clinical Research Center, and Certified Review Board (M2019‐080). This study was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs052180168, jRCTs032190244) and the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000024831). 


### Participants 
  
We recruited 22 participants who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorder based on the DSM‐IV TR or DSM‐5 criteria from the Department of Psychiatry, Kyoto University Hospital (KUHP), Japan, and the Department of Psychiatry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Japan. The FCNef group comprised 11 participants (KUHP only) from 2017 to 2020, and the control group comprised 11 participants (KUHP: nine, TMDU: two) from 2021 to 2022. Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the  . 

Written informed consent was obtained after a comprehensive description of the study had been provided. The participants were provided with financial compensation to participate in the study. 


### Adaptive N‐back Task 
  
The adaptive N‐back task was based on the single N‐back task described by Jaeggi   et al  .  and was implemented in MATLAB R2007b (MathWorks Inc.). The modifications to the original task are detailed in  . The participants completed 40 rounds daily for 5 consecutive days (days 1–5), with one session per day. Each round consisted of 20 trials, displaying a letter at the center of the PC screen for 0.5 s every 3 s, repeated 20 + N times. Participants clicked on the mouse pad when the presented letter matched one N step earlier. At the end of each round, the performance (Pr) was calculated as Pr = hit rate − false alarm rate. If Pr ≥90, N increased by one in the next round; if Pr < 70, N decreased by one; and for 70 ≤ Pr < 90, N remained unchanged (Fig.  ). The performance in the previous round determines level N in the next round. Participants were informed that the task aimed to enhance their working memory and were provided with strategies, such as chunking, word matching, and consonant blending. 

The mean N‐back level represents the average N level across all 40 rounds in a session, reflecting the participants' optimal difficulty level for the N‐back task and their working memory capability. The mean N‐back level on the fifth day was used for preintervention assessment. This task was also used for the postintervention and follow‐up assessments. 


###  MRI   Acquisition 
  
Imaging was conducted at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR) Brain Activity Imaging Center using a 3T MRI scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens) with a 32‐channel head coil. T1‐weighted structural images were acquired using a magnetization‐prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: echo time (TE), 2.22 ms; repetition time (TR), 2400 ms; inversion time, 1000 ms; field of view (FOV), 256 × 240 mm; flip angle, 8°; matrix size, 320 × 300; resolution, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm ; and slice number, 256. The T2*‐weighted gradient‐echo planar sequence parameters for the NF, resting‐state, and N‐back task runs were as follows: TE, 30 ms; TR, 1000 ms; FOV, 200 × 200 mm; flip angle, 50°; matrix size, 100 × 100; resolution, 2 × 2 × 2 mm ; slice number, 72 in interleaved order; multiband factor, 6; and scan time, 304 s (resting‐state), 402 s (N‐back task), and 512 s (NF). During the resting‐state scans, the participants were instructed to gaze at a fixation point at the center of the screen, minimize movement, and avoid thinking deeply about anything. The session order was as follows: for the pre‐, post‐, and follow‐up MRI sessions, two resting‐state runs preceded two N‐back task runs with reversed‐phase encoding, followed by T1‐weighted runs. For the NF sessions, two resting‐state runs with reversed phase‐encoding blips preceded five NF runs with anterior‐to‐posterior phase‐encoding. 


### N‐Back Task   fMRI  ; Functional Localizer Run 
  
We employed the N‐back task for the localizer run, which is well documented for activating the LFPN.  The run comprised a block design with an initial rest period (20 s), followed by six trials of the N‐back task (39 s) and rest between trials (26 s), totaling 402 s. During each rest period, the participants were instructed to focus on the fixation cross on the screen and avoid thinking deeply about anything. During the N‐back task block, a letter was presented every 3 s (stimulus duration: 0.5 s, interstimulus interval: 2.5 s), totaling 13 stimuli. Participants were required to press a button when the presented letter matched the one that appeared N steps earlier. The letters were the same as those used in the adaptive N‐back task. 

The difficulty level of the localizer N‐back task was selected from   N   = 1, 2, 3, and 4 and was individually adjusted to ensure proper activation of the LFPN. The mean N‐back level on the fifth day of the adaptive N‐back task was rounded to the nearest whole number, with a mean N‐back level of 4.5 rounded to 4, and used as the N value in the localizer task. Literature suggests that patients with schizophrenia have only been tested on 0‐, 1‐, 2‐, and 3‐back tasks, with no known reports of 4‐back or higher task performance. ,  ,  ,   We assumed a maximum preintervention mean N‐back level of 4.5, and the task was not designed for 5‐back or higher. The N‐back task fMRI scan was conducted during the pre‐FCNef, post‐FCNef, and follow‐up assessments. 


### Region of Interest Definition for NF Training 
  
The target region of interest (ROI) for the FCNef was individually created (LFPN‐ROI) and defined as the region within the LFPN template (Laird   et al  .,  BrainMap ICN18) activated by the functional localizer and included in the gray matter (GM) mask. The LFPN template encompasses the left superior parietal lobule, left medial frontal lobule, left insula, and left Broca and Wernicke areas and correlates well with working memory and language tasks. 

Using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) 5.0.10, ,  ,   T1‐weighted images were processed using the Brain Extraction Tool and FMRIB Automated Segmentation Tool, resulting in mask images of the whole brain, GM, white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The outer edges of the GM, WM, and CSF masks were eroded to mitigate the partial volume effects. 

Field maps and N‐back task echo‐planar imaging (EPI) scans were acquired using reversed phase–encoded blips to produce pairs of images with distortions in opposite directions. The susceptibility‐induced off‐resonance field was estimated using the FSL top‐up tool. ,   The estimated b0 map was then applied to the EPI scans to correct for distortions. Subsequently, each EPI scan was registered to the anatomical space, coregistered to the standard brain, and subjected to motion correction, spatial smoothing with a 4.0‐mm full‐width half‐maximum Gaussian kernel, intensity normalization, and high‐pass temporal filtering (Gaussian‐weighted least‐squares straight fitting; σ = 50.0 s). Time‐series statistical analysis estimated the beta maps using the FILM general linear model with explanatory variables for the N‐back task via FEAT first‐level analysis.  Furthermore, higher‐level FEAT analysis was used to estimate voxels that were significantly activated in the LFPN template during the N‐back task (uncorrected,   P   < 0.001). The obtained voxels were transformed into individual anatomical brain spaces via inverse deformation, masked by GM, and defined as the ROI for the FCNef intervention target (LFPN‐ROI) (Fig.  ). Four ROIs were defined as LFPN, WM, CSF, and the whole brain. Figure   shows an additive image of the LFPN‐ROIs. 


###  FC  ‐Informed NF Procedure 
  
FCNef was administered for 5 consecutive days with intermittent feedback. NF day 0 involved baseline FC measurements without feedback, whereas NF days 1 to 4 comprised the training period. We adopted an explicit approach, which is common in clinical populations, ,   by informing participants that the study aimed to “improve their working memory” and provide strategies for NF. The instructions for participants before the FCNef sessions are described in the  . The NF run included an initial rest and six subsequent trials, each comprising a preinduction rest, induction, feedback calculation, and feedback presentation (Fig.  ). The term “online” refers to the processing of fMRI scans transferred in real‐time, particularly during NF runs. Online preprocessing was time‐limited and differed from N‐back and resting‐state runs. 


### Online Processing and Calculation of Feedback Score 
  
#### NF Training Day 0: Baseline   FC  
  
NF training day 0 (NF day 0) included baseline FC measurements without feedback. Online data preprocessing was performed using proprietary software implemented in MATLAB 2007b (MathWorks Inc.), incorporating the statistical parametric software package SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging;   https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/  ). Before the NF run, the ROIs defined in the anatomical space were transformed into a functional space on each training day, and one EPI volume was scanned and coregistered to the skull‐stripped T1‐weighted image from the pre‐FCNef MRI. Inverse transformations were then applied to four ROIs: the LFPN, WM, CSF, and whole brain. During the NF run, each EPI volume was transferred to the analysis computer in real time. Each volume was realigned with the reference volume (the first volume of the run). Volumes displaying framewise displacements >0.5 mm were censored.  Subsequently, the data were denoised through linear regression using 18 parameters, including six body motion parameters, WM, CSF, the whole brain, and their derivatives. Finally, the residuals were applied to a bandpass filter ranging from 0.0078 to 0.3 Hz (Fig.  ). 

Forty volumes were obtained during the induction period to perform motion regression appropriately. The mean signal of the LFPN‐ROI during the rest period (at the beginning of the run) was subtracted from the signal from the same ROI during the induction period to obtain a better baseline for the relevant signal, and voxel‐wise blood oxygen (BOLD) signal time courses were extracted within the LFPN‐ROI. Subsequently, the FC value was calculated as the mean voxel‐wise correlation within the LFPN‐ROI as follows. The time series for each voxel was correlated with every other voxel within the mask, and this calculation was repeated for every voxel in the mask. Correlation coefficients were transformed into Fisher   z   values, which were averaged within the mask. The mean voxel‐wise correlation coefficient was consistent with the FC calculation within the same network in Yamashita   et al  .'s biomarker. ,   Taking the spatially weighted averages of multiple FCs in brain circuit biomarkers, as used in our FCNef, reduces within‐subject variation and improves signal‐to‐noise ratio. 

The mean and SD of the FC values on NF day 0 were calculated as FC  and SD . 


#### NF Training Days 1–4: Calculating Feedback Score 
  
Scores (0–100) were obtained from the FC values during the induction period and visually represented on a screen as the size of the green disk during feedback (Fig.  ). Bonuses (0–¥100 per trial) were provided according to the scores, with a maximum of ¥3000 per day in addition to the basic fee. 

The processing steps were applied to those used on NF day 0. At the end of each induction period, the voxel‐wise correlation coefficient during the induction period within the LFPN‐ROI was calculated as FC  and converted into a score using the following method: Scores above 100 were rounded to 100, and those below 0 were rounded to 0. FC  was set at a score of 50, and FC  plus or minus SD was set at 100 or 0. 



### N‐back Task Training for Control Group 
  
This task was based on the N‐back task used in NF and spanned 5 consecutive days. It was executed using Presentation Software v20.3 Build 02.25.19 (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.). Each round lasted 492 s, beginning with 120 s of rest, followed by six trials: rest (14 s), N‐back task (40 s), and post‐task review (8 s). The initial rest period featured a fixation point at the center. During the task, a letter was displayed every 4 s for 0.5 s, with no display during the review. The same letters were used in the NF runs. The N level was determined in a manner similar to the functional localizer run. Bonuses of up to ¥1000 per day were awarded based on the correct answer rates during training on days 1 to 4. Instructions for the participants are provided in the Supporting Information Methods. 


### Experimental Measures 
  
Working memory capability was assessed using the mean N‐back level in the adaptive N‐back task, digit span backward task from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd revision (WAIS‐III),  and Spatial Working Memory (SWM) task  from Cantab (Cambridge Cognition, United Kingdom). The other cognitive tests were as follows: digit span forward task from WAIS‐III for attention and working memory, Trail Making Test (TMT) part B  and Cantab SWM  task strategy for executive function, Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) immediate story and delayed story recall ,   for verbal learning and memory, TMT part A  for speed of information processing, and Cantab Reaction Time  five‐choice mean movement time, and five‐choice mean reaction time for motor and mental response speeds. Schizophrenia symptoms and functioning and quality of life were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),  the 21‐item Peters   et al  . Delusion Inventory (PDI),  BDI‐II,  Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF),  and the Japanese version of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (JSQLS). ,   PANSS analysis using a five‐factor model, preprocessing of resting‐state scans, and calculation of FC are described in the Supporting Information Methods. 


### Statistical Analysis 
  
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26 (IBM), and all tests were two‐tailed, with a significance level of 0.05. Demographic and clinical variables between the groups were evaluated using the Student   t   test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The dependent variables included age, illness duration, chlorpromazine‐equivalent antipsychotic dose, premorbid IQ, sex, and the socioeconomic status of the participants and their parents. The independent variables were group (FCNef or control). 

Demographic and clinical variables, including age and sex, showed no significant differences between groups and were not included as covariates in the analysis. A paired   t   test was used to analyze changes in the online mean FC from NF days 0 to 4, with online FC as the dependent variable and time (NF days 0 and 4) as the independent variable. Similarly, a paired   t   test was used to analyze the changes in resting‐state FC from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef, with resting‐state FC as the dependent variable and time (pre‐FCNef and post‐FCNef) as the independent variable. These comparisons were conceptually independent and analyzed separately without correction, as online and resting‐state FC reflect distinct neural states. 

Associations were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient for the following comparisons: (1) changes in the online mean FC from NF days 0 to 4 and changes in the working memory assessments from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction  applied for multiple comparisons; (2) changes in resting‐state FC from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef and working memory assessments from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef with FDR corrections were applied for multiple comparisons; and (3) changes in online mean FC from NF day 0 to day 4 and changes in resting‐state FC from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef were analyzed separately without correction, as this test did not involve working memory assessments and was considered an independent hypothesis. Age and sex were not included as covariates in the correlation analysis because no established knowledge suggests their impact on intervention‐induced FC changes. 

Group comparisons of changes in cognitive and clinical assessments from preintervention to postintervention were performed using repeated‐measures   with a two‐factor mixed design. The dependent variables were the clinical and cognitive assessment scores. The within‐subject factor was time (preintervention or postintervention), and the between‐subject factor was group (FCNef or control). FDR correction was applied for multiple comparisons. The Bonferroni method was used for multiple comparison corrections in the analysis of the interaction effects. This pilot study included multiple clinical and cognitive evaluation scales for safety assessment, and the risk of type II errors increased owing to multiple comparison corrections.  To mitigate this risk, we indicated any indicators meeting the criterion of uncorrected   P   < 0.05 in the manuscript and figures and discussed them carefully in the Discussion section. 

A one‐factor repeated‐measures   was conducted on the pre‐FCNef and post‐FCNef and follow‐up assessments in the FCNef group. The dependent variables were the clinical and cognitive assessment scores, with time (pre‐FCNef, post‐FCNef, and follow‐up) as the within‐subject factor. The Dunnett post hoc test was used to compare each time point with the preintervention assessment. FDR correction was applied for multiple comparisons among the measures. 


### Effect Size Calculation for Paired   t   Test 
  
For the paired   t   test, the effect size index dz. was calculated using G*Power 3.1.9, ,   dz. represents Cohen   d   corrected for the correlation of paired data, and was computed using the following formula: where μ  and μ  represent the population mean, σ  and σ  represent the population SD, and ρ  represents the correlation between the two random variables. 



## Results 
  
### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics 
  
No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding demographic or clinical characteristics (Table  ). One participant in the FCNef group was left‐handed, whereas all other participants were right‐handed. One participant in the FCNef group missed the follow‐up assessments because of scheduling difficulties (Fig.  ). The socioeconomic status of the parents of one participant was not confirmed. 

One control group participant had a mean N‐back level of 5.525 on the pretest, exceeding the assumed maximum of 4.5 (as described in the N‐Back Task fMRI section). We identified this score as an outlier and excluded it from analysis. The average mean N‐back level for included participants was 2.464 (SD = 0.927), with 5.525 corresponding to the mean + 3.3 SD. 

During the adaptive N‐back training, there was a significant improvement seen in the mean N‐back level for the time factor and nonsignificant effects for the interaction and group factors. The details are provided in   Results and Fig.  . 


### Changes in Online Mean   FC   During   FC  ‐Informed NF: Evaluating Training Success 
  
The mean FC value on NF day 0 was 0.050 (SD = 0.026), which increased to 0.068 (SD = 0.023) on NF day 4 (Fig.  ). A paired   t   test revealed a significant difference between NF days 0 and 4 (t [10] = 2.357,   P   = 0.040), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.001 to 0.036 and dz. = 0.71. We compared only NF days 0 and 4, when the greatest effect was expected. Although 30 trials were scheduled daily, the average number of trials per session was 28.7 (SD = 4.5, ranging from 6 to 30) owing to experimental time constraints and participant fatigue. One participant missed NF day 4 of the FCNef; therefore, NF day 3 data were substituted in the analysis. All other participants were present on all days. A sensitivity analysis of substitution was conducted, and the results remained consistent across all approaches ( ). For the feedback scores, see   and Fig.  .

A paired   t   test revealed a significant difference between NF days 0 and 4 (t [10] = 2.357,   P   = 0.040), with a 95% CI of 0.001 to 0.036 and dz. of 0.71.

### Correlation Between Changes in Online   FC   and Working Memory Tests 
  
The Pearson correlation coefficient was   r   = 0.69 between the change in mean N‐back level (from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef) and the change in mean FC value (from NF days 0–4), with a significant   P‐  value of 0.019 and a 95% CI of 0.15 to 0.91 (Fig.  ). After applying multiple comparison corrections, the results remained statistically significant (false discovery rate–adjusted   P  ‐value [pFDR] = 0.038). The Pearson correlation coefficient was   r   = 0.32 between the change in the digit span backward task (from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef) and the mean FC value (from NF days 0–4), with a   P‐  value of 0.35 (pFDR = 0.35) and a 95% CI of −0.35 to 0.77 (Fig.  ). One participant missed NF day 4 of the FCNef; therefore, NF day 3 data were substituted in the analysis.

The change in the mean FC value (from NF days 0 to 4), with a significant   P   value of 0.019 (pFDR = 0.038) and a 95% CI of 0.15 to 0.91, indicated that the more successfully participants enhanced their FC, the more their mean N‐back level improved.   (b)   Pearson correlation coefficient was   r   = 0.32 between the change in the digit span backward task (from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef) and the change in the mean FC value (from NF days 0 to 4), with a   P   value of 0.35 (pFDR = 0.35) and a 95% CI of −0.35 to 0.77.

The pre‐FCNef mean FC value was 0.206 (SD = 0.023) and the post‐FCNef mean FC value increased to 0.252 (SD = 0.073) (Fig.  ). A paired   t   test identified a significant difference (t [10] = 2.270,   P   = 0.047), with a 95% CI of 0.000856 to 0.0922 and a dz. of 0.684. The Pearson correlation coefficient was   r   = 0.13 between changes in resting‐state FC and online FC (from NF days 0 to 4), with a   P  ‐value of 0.71 and a 95% CI ranging from −0.51 to 0.68 (Fig.  ).

### Changes in Preintervention and Postintervention Assessments Between   FC  ‐Informed NF and Control Groups 
  
 identified an interaction effect on the digit span backward task (F [1, 19] = 5.24,   P   = 0.034, partial η  = 0.216; Table  , Fig.  ). However, after applying multiple comparison corrections, the effect was no longer statistically significant (pFDR = 0.63). The interaction analysis results were as follows: the FCNef group's mean score on the digit span backward task was 6.1 (SD = 1.7) preintervention and 7.1 (SD = 2.3) postintervention; the control group's mean score on the task was 5.9 (SD = 2.2) preintervention and 5.6 (SD = 2.8) postintervention. When the group factor was FCNef, a significant difference was observed in the time factor (pre < post,   P   = 0.019 [95% CI, 0.18–1.82]), and when the group factor was controlled, no significant difference was observed in the time factor (  P   = 0.47). No significant group differences were found for the time factor preintervention (  P   = 0.83) or postintervention (  P   = 0.19).

Blue and orange lines represent the FCNef and control groups, respectively. The mean score for each group is depicted by a dot (FCNef group) or a square (control group), and the SD is represented by an error bar.   (a)   identified an interaction effect on the digit span backward task (F [1, 19] = 5.24 [  P   = 0.034†], pFDR = 0.63; partial η  = 0.216). The interaction analysis results were as follows: the FCNef group's mean score on the digit span backward task was 6.1 (SD = 1.7) preintervention and 7.1 (SD = 2.3) postintervention; the control group's mean score on the task was 5.9 (SD = 2.2) preintervention and 5.6 (SD = 2.8) postintervention. When the group factor was the FCNef, a significant difference was observed in the time factor (pre < post,   P   = 0.019‡ [95% CI, 0.18–1.82]). When the group factor was controlled, no significant difference was observed in the time factor (  P   = 0.47). No significant group differences were found for the time factor preintervention (  P   = 0.83) or postintervention (  P   = 0.19).   (b)–(f)  . Significant differences were found for the time factor, while nonsignificant differences were found for the group factor or interaction effect in the following assessments: PANSS cognitive factor (  P   = 0.037, F [1, 19] = 5.01; partial η  = 0.21), TMT part B (  P   = 0.028, F [1, 19] = 5.63; partial η  = 0.23), BDI‐II (  P   < 0.001, F [1, 19] = 20.77; partial η  = 0.52), RBMT story immediate recall (  P   = 0.005, F [1, 19] = 10.07; partial η  = 0.35), and RBMT story delayed recall (  P   = 0.002, F [1, 19] = 13.23; partial η  = 0.41). The mean scores of these scales improved after the intervention. After applying multiple comparison corrections, the RBMT story immediate recall (pFDR = 0.033), delayed recall (pFDR = 0.02), and BDI‐II (pFDR = 0.004) remained significant.

Differences were found in the time factor, while nonsignificant differences were found for the group factor or interaction effect in the following assessments: PANSS cognitive factor (  P   = 0.037, F [1, 19] = 5.01, partial η  = 0.21), TMT Part B (  P   = 0.028, F [1, 19] = 5.63, partial η  = 0.23), BDI‐II (  P   < 0.001, F [1, 19] = 20.77, partial η  = 0.52), RBMT story immediate recall (  P   = 0.005, F [1, 19] = 10.07, partial η  = 0.35), and RBMT story delayed recall (  P   = 0.002, F [1, 19] = 13.23, partial η  = 0.41) (Table  , Fig.  ). After applying multiple comparison corrections, the RBMT story immediate recall (pFDR = 0.033), delayed recall (pFDR = 0.02), and BDI‐II (pFDR = 0.004) remained significant. Mean BDI‐II scores were decreased in the FCNef group (from 17.2 [SD = 10.9] to 12.5 [SD = 8.5]), control group (from 13.5 [SD = 7.3] to 10.8 [SD = 7.4]), and all participants (from 15.4 [SD = 9.3] to 11.7 [SD = 7.9]). For the RBMT story immediate recall, the mean scores increased in the FCNef group (from 9.2 [SD = 5.8] to 12.2 [SD = 5.3]), control group (from 7.7 [SD = 4.5] to 9.7 [SD = 6.2]), and all participants (from 8.5 [SD = 5.2] to 11.0 [SD = 5.7]). Similarly, mean delayed recall scores increased in the FCNef group (from 8.0 [SD = 5.6] to 11.1 [SD = 4.0]), control group (from 7.1 [SD = 4.0] to 8.5 [SD = 5.0]), and all participants (from 7.5 [SD = 4.8] to 9.9 [SD = 4.6]). 


### Follow‐up Assessments in the   FC  ‐Informed NF Group 
  
A follow‐up MRI scan was performed 1 to 3 months after NF completion with a mean interval of 57 days (SD = 20 days, range: 31–82 days). Cognitive and clinical assessments were performed within 1 week of the MRI. One participant missed the follow‐up assessment because of scheduling difficulties and was excluded from the statistical tests. A time effect was observed for TMT Part B (F [2, 18] = 4.006 [  P   = 0.036], pFDR = 0.18; partial η  = 0.308) (Table  ), PANSS cognitive factor (F [2, 18] = 3.613 [  P   = 0.048], pFDR = 0.192; partial η  = 0.286), RBMT story immediate recall (F [2, 18] = 7.018 [  P   = 0.006], pFDR = 0.053; partial η  = 0.438), delayed recall (F [2, 18] = 6.377 [  P   = 0.008], pFDR = 0.053; partial η  = 0.415), and BDI‐II (F [2, 18] = 7.082 [  P   = 0.005], pFDR = 0.053; partial η  = 0.440). These effects were not significant after applying multiple comparison corrections. The mean LFPN FC on resting‐state imaging at follow‐up was higher than pre‐FCNef but lower than post‐FCNef (Fig.  ).   did not identify significant time effects (F [2, 18] = 1.576 [  P   = 0.234], partial η  = 0.149). 
  
Clinical and cognitive outcomes in the FCNef group at follow‐up assessments 
    


## Discussion 
  
A two‐arm, nonrandomized, controlled pilot study of connectivity‐informed NF designed to enhance FC within the LFPN was conducted to improve working memory in patients with schizophrenia. The FC value of the LFPN in the FCNef group significantly increased on NF day 4 compared with that on NF day 0 (Fig.  ), indicating successful NF training. A significant correlation was found between the increase in FC values from NF days 0 to 4 and the improvement in the mean N‐back level post‐FCNef. The more the FCNef participants enhanced their FC, the more their mean N‐back level improved. When comparing improvements in the cognitive and clinical assessments of the FCNef group with those of the control group, an interaction effect was observed in the digit span backward task. The FCNef group demonstrated markedly improved scores on the post‐FCNef task compared with the pre‐FCNef task. In the resting‐state images scanned on a different day from the NF intervention, the FC values within the LFPN were significantly increased post‐FCNef compared with pre‐FCNef. 

We assumed that the FCNef group would show improvements in two working memory assessments (mean N‐back level and digit span backward task) compared with the control group and that increased FC during FCNef would correlate with these improvements. However, while digit span backward task scores improved remarkably post‐FCNef, they did not correlate significantly with increased online FC. Conversely, the mean N‐back level was significantly correlated with increased online FC, but did not improve post‐FCNef. 

A repeated‐measures   of the mean N‐back level revealed no main effects or interactions, indicating no group differences in the pattern of performance change between the FCNef and control groups and no significant improvement from preintevention to postintervention (Table  ). However, a significantly strong positive correlation (0.69) was found between changes in FC values (from NF days 0–4) and changes in the mean N‐back level (pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef) (Fig.  ). The mean N‐back level improved with adaptive N‐back training preceding NF (Fig.  ). Even after improving task performance through in‐depth training, the performance improved with the degree of FC enhancement, suggesting that those who can enhance LFPN FC during FCNef can improve their working memory. 

Upon comparing the improvements in the cognitive and clinical assessments of the FCNef group with those of the control group, an interaction effect was observed in the digit span backward task (Table  , Fig.  ). Notably, the FCNef group exhibited a pronounced improvement in the post‐FCNef task, suggesting that the improvement was attributable to FCNef rather than repeated testing or the N‐back task implemented as the FCNef strategy. However, the improvement in digit span backward task score did not significantly correlate with the increase in online FC (r = 0.32, Fig.  ). 

Decreased digit span backward task scores have been reported in patients with schizophrenia. ,   In the WAIS‐III standardization sample, the mean score for patients with schizophrenia was 5.76 (SD = 1.91), which was significantly lower than that of the healthy controls (mean = 7.19, SD = 2.62).  In our study, preintervention mean scores were 6.1 (SD = 1.7) for FCNef, 5.9 (SD = 2.2) for controls, and 6.0 (SD = 1.9) overall—comparable to or slightly higher than those reported for patients with schizophrenia. Postintervention, the FCNef group improved to 7.1 (SD = 2.3), with a 95% CI difference of 0.18 to 1.82, reaching a level similar to healthy controls in the WAIS‐III data set. However, slight differences in the age distribution in the WAIS‐III data set (mean: 38.2 [SD = 6.1])  and our study (mean: 38.1 [SD = 8.5]) require cautious interpretation. Notable improvement was observed in the FCNef group. 

A significant main effect of time was observed for the BDI‐II and RBMT story immediate and delayed recall (Table  , Fig.  ), although no group‐by‐time interactions were noted. These assessments revealed worse scores in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy controls. ,  ,   The observed reductions in BDI‐II scores, implying nonspecific intervention effects, may be due to the participants perceiving the continuous involvement of researchers (medical professionals) during the intervention as supportive or a source of relief. The RBMT story immediate and delayed recall tests are similar to logical memory tests and are known to show learning effects from repeated testing.  Improvements in the results of these tests may be attributed to learning effects and N‐back task training during the intervention. Notably, no significant deterioration was observed in the clinical and cognitive assessment results compared with those in the control group. 

Resting‐state LFPN FC values were significantly increased post‐FCNef compared with pre‐FCNef. These resting‐state scans were performed on a different day from the NF and started at the beginning of the imaging protocol, potentially reflecting intrinsic activation. Contrary to our expectations, no correlation was observed between the changes in online FC values (from NF days 0–4) and resting‐state FC values (pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef). The relatively small sample size may have affected the results. Our target LFPN‐ROI included the insula and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Fig.  ), regions implicated in NF learning,  which may influence resting‐state FC changes. A more comprehensive study involving a larger sample size and resting‐state imaging of a control group may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying this transfer effect. 

A moderate but not statistically significant correlation coefficient (0.43) was observed between changes in resting‐state LFPN FC and changes in the digit span backward task from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef (Fig.  ). This association corresponds to the relationship demonstrated for a working memory capability biomarker based on resting‐state FC within the LFPN, as indicated by Yamashita   et al  . ,   Meanwhile, a weak and nonsignificant correlation was observed between the changes in resting‐state LFPN FC and mean N‐back level from pre‐FCNef to post‐FCNef (Fig.  ). The small sample size may have affected the varying results among working memory assessments. 

In the follow‐up assessments, the increase in resting‐state FC and improvement in the digit span backward task declined but remained higher than in the pre‐FCNef assessment. However, the interpretation is limited by the variability in time intervals between post‐FCNef and follow‐up assessments and the absence of a control group. 

Previous studies using fMRI NF for emotion recognition,  auditory hallucinations, ,  ,  ,  ,   theory of mind,  and attempts to increase anterior cingulate cortex activity  have reported successful score increases during NF, with some studies showing correlations between neural and behavioral changes. ,  ,  ,  ,   Similarly, our study demonstrated increased FC during NF and a correlation between neural and behavioral changes. Impaired neural plasticity has been well documented.  Our results indicate that increased LFPN FC is associated with improved working memory, suggesting a potential neural plasticity in schizophrenia. In addition, working memory predicts community living and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia. ,   Although improvements in working memory might have contributed to these outcomes, this short‐term study could not assess them. Future studies should explore the long‐term impacts on social functioning and quality of life. 

Moreover, our biomarker‐based FCNef study demonstrated a neural‐behavioral correlation with longitudinal changes, highlighting the significance of the biomarker. The correlation between the improvement in the mean N‐back level and increased FC within the LFPN raises the possibility of a causal relationship between the LFPN and working memory. In the future, causal inference may be further explored using the FCNef and decoded NF. ,  

This study has several limitations that warrant further investigation. First, the small sample size limited the statistical power of the study, reduced its ability to detect actual effects, and increased the risk of type II errors. Moreover, random noise may have influenced the results, given the variability in cognitive, clinical, and FC measures. Second, the nonrandomized study design, differences in study duration, and variations in experimental facilities may have introduced systematic differences in confounding variables such as baseline cognitive ability, medication status, or socioeconomic factors, potentially compromising the validity of the comparisons. Third, the absence of MRI and follow‐up assessments in the control group limited our ability to determine whether the improvements observed in the FCNef group were specific to NF. Fourth, this study lacked double‐anonymized and sham feedback. Performing the same N‐back task without brain activity feedback served as a mental rehearsal control outside the scanner, as described by Sorger   et al  .  While this controlled for the strategy's behavioral effects, it did not account for the placebo effect of training in a high‐tech environment, motivational influences, or a sense of accomplishment from successful control. Moreover, the absence of double anonymization may have biased both the participants' task behaviors and the researchers' interpretations of the results. Fede   et al  .  recommended two control conditions: sham feedback and no NF. Fifth, the effects of anticholinergics and benzodiazepines have not yet been fully examined. Future studies should consider these factors. 

In summary, the present fMRI NF in patients with schizophrenia was conducted safely, with no adverse events or worsening of symptoms, compared with the control group. This study highlights the potential of FCNef to enhance FC within the LFPN as a novel therapeutic approach for improving working memory in patients with schizophrenia. In addition to improvements in working memory, further development of NF targeting schizophrenia symptoms that do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medications is expected in the future.  Moreover, with the accessibility of large MRI databases for various neuropsychiatric disorders,  the development of FC‐based biomarkers and FCNef for these disorders is likely to gain momentum.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide switching between activity states using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia pathophysiology. 
  
Working memory requires the brain to switch between cognitive states and activity patterns. Here, the authors show that the steering of these neural network dynamics is influenced by dopamine D1- and D2-receptor function and altered in schizophrenia.

## Introduction 
  
Working memory is an essential part of executive cognition depending on prefrontal neurons functionally modulated through dopamine D1 and D2 receptor activation . The dual-state theory of prefrontal dopamine function links the differential activation of dopamine receptors to two discrete dynamical regimes: a D1-dominated state with a high energy barrier favoring robust maintenance of cognitive representations and a D2-dominated state with a flattened energy landscape enabling flexible switching between states . Recent accounts extend the idea of dopamine’s impact on working memory from a local prefrontal to a brain-wide network perspective , emphasizing the dual role of dopamine in regulating the complex interplay between striatal and prefrontal circuits critical for balancing the stability-flexibility tradeoff. Indeed, several lines of research support the notion that dopamine actions in frontal-parietal regions contribute to both maintaining cortical representations , and the flexible switching between different representations . Notably, a large body of evidence further demonstrates that the latter process additionally involves striatal-cortical interactions , suggesting a gating function of the striatum for cortical memory representations . These accounts highlight the contribution of widespread neural circuits and their regulation by dopamine to working memory. 

Several lines of work support the idea that proper working memory execution requires the ordered transition through global brain states and the flexible reconfiguration of brain-wide interactions . Notably, multiple studies have demonstrated that these temporal reconfigurations are altered in schizophrenia . The complex dynamics of state transitions unfold upon the underlying structural scaffold whose architecture shapes the structure-function relationship  and constrains the dynamic repertoire enabling executive functioning . However, it remains unclear how the brain controls, steers, and guides transitions between these different states and which brain components underlie the coordinated adaptation of brain-wide activity patterns. 

A promising tool to study these questions and concepts derived from the dual-state theory is network control theory (NCT). NCT has been recently introduced to neuroscience  and can be used to model brain network dynamics as a function of interconnecting white matter tracts and regional control energy . Such dynamics are framed upon brain states, which are defined as a whole-brain pattern of activity at a given moment in time. Based on the structural connectome, NCT can be used to examine the landscape of brain activity states: That is, which states would the system have difficulty accessing, and more importantly, which regions need to be influenced and to what extent to make those states accessible or to maintain those states . 

Here, using NCT, we study transitions between (and the stability of) whole-brain neural states measured by fMRI during a well-established working memory task (Fig.  ). Building on a brain parcellation spanning both cortical and subcortical areas (see “Methods”), we define brain states as individual brain activity patterns related to a working memory condition (2-back) and to an attention control condition requiring motor response (0-back) in a sample of 178 healthy individuals undergoing fMRI. Separately, we obtain structural connectomes from fiber tracking along white matter tracts measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired in the same participants. We approximate brain dynamics locally by a simple linear dynamical system and compute the local and global control energy necessary to drive or maintain certain activity patterns.    Theory and methods.  
A summary of the methods to assess brain dynamics using network control theory. We use a multimodal atlas and apply it to both diffusion tensor imaging to obtain a structural connectome, and to functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain activation patterns during 0-back and 2-back working memory tasks. Finally, we use network control theory to explain transitions between 0-back and 2-back states based on the underlying structural connectome. Here,   x   denotes the initial state of the system,   x   denotes the desired final state,   x  (  t  ) is the state of the system at time   t  ,   A   is the wiring diagram of the underlying network,   B   denotes an input matrix defining the control nodes, and   u  (  t  ) is the time-dependent control signal. For further mathematical details, please see the “Methods” section. 
  

Within this statistical framework, we test the following predictions of the dual-state theory of brain network function and evaluate their implications for schizophrenia. Specifically, (I) we posit that brain states related to high cognitive effort are harder to maintain, e.g., exhibit decreased stability and require more control energy to be accessed, than states related to low cognitive effort. (II) Using individual predicted gene co-expression indices for dopamine receptors, we test the hypothesis that the stability of brain states should be related to D1 receptor function, while D2 receptor function should be associated with decreased efforts to flexibly switch between global activity patterns. (III) We further validate these hypotheses and provide mechanistic support by pharmacologically blocking D2-receptor function in vivo, which should drive the system into a state where the switching between activity patterns requires more effort, e.g., demand more control energy. Finally, (IV) by considering the known cognitive deficits and structural network alterations in schizophrenia, we test our prediction that patients experience a reduced ability to control global reconfigurations of brain states. 


## Results 
  
### Brain state stability and control over brain state transitions in health 
  
We begin by asking how the brain transitions between different cognitive states during the performance of a well-established N-back working memory task. We define individual brain states as spatial patterns of β estimates associated with activity across brain regions of interest during a working memory condition (2-back) and during an attention control condition requiring motor response (0-back). It is important to note that our definition of brain states relates to the statistical spatial pattern of β estimates from a general linear model and does not reflect neuronal activity occurring en masse as, for example, in neurophysiological animal experiments. To quantify the energy efforts associated with a specific transition from an initial state    x    to a target state    x   , we approximate brain dynamics locally by a simple linear dynamical system, where   x  (  t  ) is the brain state of the system,   A   is a structural connectome inferred from DTI data,   u  (  t  ) is the control input, and   B   is a matrix describing which regions are control nodes. After finding the optimal control input   u   that enables a transition, the control energy of each node is calculated as the squared integral over time of   u  ; intuitively, this quantity measures the control input that the node has to exhibit to facilitate the transitions from the initial state to the target state. Similarly, the stability of a brain state can be defined as the inverse control energy needed to maintain a specific state. In this framework, control energy can be interpreted as the effort of a brain region needed to steer the activity pattern of itself and its connected brain regions into the desired final activation state; relatedly, stability can be interpreted as the effort of a brain region needed to maintain a given activity pattern of itself and its connected brain regions. For a more detailed mathematical description of the network control framework, please see the “Methods” section and  . 

Following the control theory framework, we started by computing the stability of both cognitive states as well as the control energy of the transitions between them in a sample of healthy individuals (Table  ). As expected, the cognitively more demanding 2-back brain state was less stable (i.e., required higher energy for maintenance) than the motor control state (Fig.  ; repeated-measures ANOVA: main effect of 0- vs. 2-back stability:   F  (1,173) = 66.80,   p   < 0.001, age, sex and brain activity as covariates of non-interest). Further, the stability of the 2-back state was significantly associated with working memory accuracy (Fig.  ;   b   = 0.274,   p   = 0.006, age, sex, and brain activity as covariates of non-interest). These findings suggest that more stable 2-back network representations in the form of whole-brain activity patterns  support better working memory performance.

We next studied how the brain flexibly changes its activity pattern between states. Transitioning into the cognitively more demanding 2-back state required more control energy than the opposite transition (Fig.  ; repeated-measures ANOVA:   F  (1174) = 27.98,   p   = 0.001, age, sex and difference in brain activity as covariates of non-interest). To investigate which brain regions are the most important controllers in these transitions, we sought to quantify the influence that a single brain region has on the entire system’s dynamics during state trajectories. To that purpose, we computed the control impact of each node by iteratively removing one brain region from the network and re-computing the change in control energy. Exploratory visualization of the 20% of brain regions that exhibited the highest control impact in both transitions suggested that prefrontal and parietal cortices steer both types of transitions, while default-mode areas are preferentially important for switching to the more cognitively demanding state (Fig.  ; see SI for illustration of alternative thresholds). 


### Brain state stability and control energy relate to predicted frontal dopamine D1 and D2-receptor expression 
  
Following from the dual-state theory of network function, the stability of task-related brain states should be related to prefrontal D1 receptor status. To estimate individual prefrontal D1 receptor expression in each participant, we utilized methods relating prefrontal cortex D1 and D2 receptor expression to genetic variation in their co-expression partner, thereby enabling us to predict individual dopamine receptor expression levels from genotype data across the whole genome . Specifically, previous work using weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis  applied on the Braincloud dataset of post-mortem DLPFC gene expression  had identified 67 non-overlapping sets of genes based on their expression pattern. The co-expression gene sets including DRD1 and DRD2 were summarized into Polygenic Co-expression Indices (PCIs) based on weighted SNPs that predicted co-expression of these genes. Based on these weighted sums of SNPs, we calculated individual PCI scores related to D1 and D2 receptor expression for a subset of 64 individuals for which human GWAS data were available (for more details see “Methods” and SI). In these individuals, we found that the D1 (but not D2) expression-related gene score predicted stability of both states (Fig.  ; 0-back:   b   = 0.184,   p   = 0.034; 2-back:   b   = 0.242,   p   = 0.007, age, sex, brain activity, and first 5 genetic PCA components as covariates of non-interest), in line with the assumed role of dopamine D1-related signaling in maintaining stable activity patterns during task performance .    Dopamine receptor expression and pharmacological modulation impact whole-brain dynamics.  
 a   Genetic scores predicting DRD1 expression in prefrontal regions positively predict stability of both brain states (0-back:   b   = 0.184,   p   = 0.034; 2-back:   b   = 0.242   p   = 0.007; age, sex, mean brain state activity, and first 5 genetic PCA components as covariates of non-interest).   b   Genetic scores predicting DRD2 expression in prefrontal regions negatively predict control energy for both brain state transitions (0-back to 2-back:   b   = −0.076,   p   = 0.037; and trend wise for 2-back to 0-back:   b   = −0.134,   p   = 0.068; age, sex, mean brain activity difference, and first 5 genetic PCA components, stability of 0-back and 2-back as covariates of non-interest).   c   Amisulpride (AMI) increases control energy for transitions in comparison to placebo (PLA) (main effect of drug:   F  (1,10) = 7.27,   p   = 0.022; interaction drug by condition:   F  (1,10) = 0.42,   p   = 0.665, activity difference, drug order, and sex as covariates of non-interest). Black lines indicate mean values and boxes indicate one standard deviation of the mean.   d   Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) need more control energy when transitioning into the working memory condition than matched healthy controls (HC) (  F  (1,98) = 5.238,   p   =  0.024, age, sex, tSNR and mean activity as covariates of non-interest), but not vice versa. Black lines indicate mean, dark boxes indicate 1 standard deviation, light boxes indicate 1.96 SEM. Source data are provided with this paper. 
  

Following predictions from the dual-state theory, switching between different activity representations should relate to dopamine D2 receptor function, independent of stability. Indeed, when controlling for stability as a nuisance covariate in the regression model, the control energy of both state transitions could be predicted by the D2 (but not the D1) receptor expression gene score (Fig.  ; 0- to 2-back:   b   = −0.076,   p   = 0.037; and trending for 2- to 0-back:   b   = −0.134,   p   = 0.068, age, sex, the difference in brain activity, and first 5 genetic PCA components as covariates of non-interest), in line with the assumed role of dopamine D2 receptor function in lowering energy barriers between states  and thus enabling flexible switching between neural representations . 


### Brain state transitions can be modulated by D2 receptor antagonism 
  
Our results thus far support the notion that the brain is a dynamical system in which the stability of a state is substantially defined by cognitive effort and modulated by D1 receptor expression, while transitions between states depend primarily on D2 receptor expression. If true, such a system should be sensitive to dopaminergic manipulation, and interference with D2-related signaling should reduce the brain’s ability to control its optimal trajectories, i.e., increase the control energy needed when switching between states. To test these hypotheses, we investigated an independent sample of healthy controls (  n   = 16, Table  ) receiving 400 mg Amisulpride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pharmacological fMRI study. Importantly, because no DTI data were acquired in this study, we used a link-wise averaged connectivity matrix from all healthy subjects in study 1, following previous work .

Consistent with our expectations, we observed that greater control energy was needed for transitions under D2 receptor blockade (Fig.  ; repeated-measures ANOVA with drug and transition as within-subject factors; main effect of the drug:   F  (1,10) = 7.27,   p   = 0.022; drug-by-condition interaction:   F  (1,10) = 0.42,   p   = 0.665, sex, the difference in brain activity, and drug order as covariates of non-interest). In contrast, we observed no effect on the stability of states; that is, the inverse control energy required to stabilize a current state was not impacted by the pharmacological manipulation (main effect of drug:   F  (1,8) = 0.715,   p   = 0.422, sex, brain activity, and drug order as covariates of non-interest). Importantly, we were able to trend-wise replicate the results of the pharmacological intervention with risperidone, a substance showing lower D2-receptor selectivity (repeated-measures ANOVA with drug and transition as within-subject factors, the main effect of the drug:   F  (1,10) = 3.490, sex, the difference in brain activity, and drug order as covariates of non-interest,   p   = 0.091; repeated-measures ANOVA with drug and stability as within-subject factors, the main effect of the drug:   F  (1,8) = 1.057,   p   = 0.334, sex, brain activity, and drug order as covariates of non-interest, see Supplementary Table  ). 


### Reduced brain state stability and control over brain state transitions in schizophrenia 
  
Dopamine dysfunction, working memory deficits, and alterations in brain network organization are hallmarks of schizophrenia . We therefore tested for differences in the state stability and in the ability to control state transitions between 24 individuals with schizophrenia and a healthy control sample balanced for age, sex, performance, head motion, and premorbid IQ, but different in signal-noise-ratio (tSNR) (Table  ). Stability in individuals with schizophrenia was reduced for the cognitively demanding working memory state (  F  (1,98) = 6.43,   p   = 0.013, age, sex, brain activity, and tSNR as covariates of non-interest), but not for the control condition (  F  (1,98) = 0.052,   p   = 0.840, same covariates; Supplementary Table  ). The control energy needed for the 0- to 2-back transition was significantly higher in schizophrenia than in controls (Fig.  ;   F  (1,98) = 5.238,   p   = 0.024, age, sex, the difference in brain activity, and tSNR as covariates of non-interest), while the opposite transition (2-back to 0-back) showed no significant group difference (ANOVA:   F  (1,98) = 0.620,   p   = 0.433, same covariates; Supplementary Table  )  .   These results suggest that the brain energy landscape is more diverse in schizophrenia than in controls, making the system more difficult to steer appropriately. 

To further strengthen this notion, we estimated the variability in suboptimal (higher energy) trajectories connecting different cognitive states by enacting subtle random perturbations to the minimum energy trajectories over 200 iterations (see “Methods”). In a diversified energy landscape, we expected that the variation of trajectories around the minimum-energy trajectory should be larger than in the less diversified energy landscape of healthy controls, implying that small perturbations may have a more substantial impact in schizophrenia. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the variability in such perturbed trajectories was indeed increased in schizophrenia compared to controls (rm-ANOVA: main effect of group:   F  (1,98) = 4.789,   p   = 0.031, age, sex, tSNR as covariates of non-interest). Together, these findings suggest that working memory brain states are less stable in schizophrenia, harder to control, and more susceptible to disturbance compared to healthy controls. 



## Discussion 
  
Working memory is a core cognitive function that encompasses the ability to maintain but also update and manipulate cognitive representations to successfully perform ongoing tasks. The underlying neural substrate of these processes critically depends on the coordinated reconfiguration and persistence of distinct global neural activity patterns that are modulated by the differential actions of dopamine signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that the stability of and switching between global brain activation patterns during working memory can be meaningfully assessed by NCT, providing a putative mechanism for the brain’s capacity to control the unfolding of activity patterns on top of the underlying structural connectome. We further demonstrate that these processes are modulated by dopamine signaling in accordance with the dual-state theory of dopamine, and that they are altered in schizophrenia as expected by current pathophysiological network hypotheses  in this disorder. 

Our study extends the current knowledge in the field in several notable ways. Firstly, our results demonstrate that the cognitively more demanding state exhibits lower stability, i.e., requires more control energy to be maintained. Indeed, tasks requiring additional working memory demands have been shown to be associated with increased metabolic and attentional demands , as well as exhibiting more extended spatial distributions of activity  and less neuronal selectivity , which could account for the increased control efforts needed to actively retain and steer the neural system towards this dynamic network state. Notably, we also found that the stability of the cognitively demanding state was further associated with better working memory performance, complementing previous evidence demonstrating that increased brain state stability is accompanied by greater behavioral performance across a spectrum of tasks . 

Further, switching to the cognitively more demanding and less stable state required more control energy than the inverse transition. The direction of these differences suggests that the cognitively more demanding state was more difficult to access, a notion that is in line with the idea of associated switch costs when turning to more difficult tasks . Importantly, these analyses were performed while controlling for the effects of mean brain activation; therefore, the results cannot be explained as mere epiphonema of global or local brain activity levels as measured by fMRI, which have previously been shown to be task- and cognitive-load dependent . When examining the regional contributions of brain areas to the control of state switching, we are able to differentiate between (i) a universal set of brain regions mainly located in prefrontal and parietal cortices supporting both transitions, and (ii) medial structures in default-mode related areas that showed particularly strong involvement in 0- to 2-back transitions. These results are in line with previous predictions from network control studies indicating that PFC areas are essential for controlling transitions into hard-to-reach states , and further support the assumed role of frontal-parietal circuits in steering brain dynamics  and their prominent role in shifting tasks . The findings also emphasize the importance of the coordinated behavior of brain systems commonly displaying deactivations during demanding cognitive tasks . 

Secondly, in line with the prediction of the dual-state theory of network function, we show that the ability to control brain dynamics during working memory is differentially modulated by D1/D2 dopamine receptor functioning. D1-receptor signaling in frontal circuits has been previously shown to facilitate working memory by tuning signal-to-noise ratios in pyramidal neurons , enabling stable network activation patterns that support the maintenance of neural representations . In contrast, D2-receptor activation in PFC can lead to decreased GABA and NMDA receptor-related currents, thereby counteracting D1-receptor activity and ultimately enabling higher flexibility and switching between cognitive representations . While these insights focus on cortical microcircuits and are derived from animal studies and theoretical modeling, our results complement previous work demonstrating that similar principles govern the modulatory actions of D1 (and D2 receptors) at the macroscopic level of brain-wide networks, particularly in frontal-parietal circuits . 

It is important to note that our data provide an association of whole-brain processes with PCIs derived from prefrontal areas, and that previous studies have demonstrated differential expression patterns of dopamine receptors for prefrontal and striatal areas as well as differential (and even antagonist) behavior of dopamine receptor stimulation in striatal and prefrontal circuits . Therefore, it seems plausible that our results mainly reflect dopamine actions as observed in PFC-related circuits, which are also the dominant control nodes in our model facilitating both state transitions. Both observations would support a model of frontal-parietal circuits serving as hub regions modulated by D2-receptor signaling, which controls and facilitates the flexible adaptation of brain-wide activity and connectivity patterns . While our model concentrates on PFC-related dopamine action, it does not exclude the increasingly important concept that emphasizes the additional role of striatal input and output gating as dopamine-related mechanisms contributing to a stability-flexibility tradeoff critical for cognitive control, task-switching, and working memory . However, studying the differential contributions of striatal and frontal dopamine signaling on working memory in future studies will require a finer-grained task design to disentangle the several cognitive subprocesses that are currently mingled in the two conditions of our N-back task. The idea of dopamine-related frontal-parietal circuits as important regions for flexibly controlling the reconfiguration of brain-wide activity patterns is further supported by our pharmacological intervention, where we observe a specific increase of control energy for switching brain activation patterns after D2-blockade, but no effect on the stability of these patterns. Here, future work quantifying brain-wide D1- and D2-receptor levels in vivo in combination with pharmacological manipulations would provide valuable and strongly needed data to disentangle the specific contributions of the spatial distribution and different receptor subtypes to working memory processes. 

Thirdly, we show that individuals with schizophrenia show reduced controllability and stability of working memory network dynamics, consistent with the idea of an altered functional architecture and energy landscape of cognitive brain networks. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been repeatedly linked to altered dopamine-related brain activations in prefrontal circuits, showing a complex U-shaped dependency shaped by genetics, task difficulty, medication, and dopamine levels . In previous work we have shown that these deficits are accompanied by less stable, brain-wide network configurations during working memory , extended by our current observations that the stability of brain activation patterns is specific to cognitive demanding states. Importantly, our samples were balanced in terms of working memory performance, and therefore the observed differences are unlikely a mere result of performance levels. 

Although less stable, cognitive states were more difficult to access, which seemingly contradicts our results of increased control energy after D2-blockade, but is in line with clinical observations that D2-blockade does not ameliorate cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia . Instead, our additional analysis on the variability of trajectories suggests that the increased demand for control energy in our individuals with schizophrenia is potentially a direct result of a more diverse and therefore harder-to-navigate control landscape. This landscape is mainly shaped by the topology of the underlying structural connectome , for which meso-scale alterations, such as reduced modularity and disruptions of the rich-club , are prominent in schizophrenia. Such alterations are thought to result in a biased trade-off between integration and segregation , and in an increased subtle randomization . Our results therefore provide a mechanistic explanation for how connectome disruption can lead to altered brain dynamics and cognition in schizophrenia. 

Several aspects of our work require special consideration. Firstly, to relate brain dynamics to cognitive function, we focus on discrete “meta-level” brain states where each state is summarized by a single brain activation pattern rather than a linear combination of multiple brain activity patterns. These brain states do not purely reflect a single process but instead involve several cognitive subprocesses. Future studies could use specific paradigms to disentangle these subprocesses, in combination with more direct and higher time-resolved measures of brain activity such as MEG. Secondly, although we could demonstrate a link between brain dynamics, measured by means of control energy, and predicted prefrontal dopamine receptor expression, the link is indirect and requires confirmation by direct measurements. Thirdly, we cannot exclude the possibility that disorder severity, duration, symptoms, or medication may have influenced network dynamics in individuals with schizophrenia (see SI). Finally, while the sample sizes of our pharmacological and patient study are rather small, we were able to show comparable effects of dopaminergic manipulation on control properties using a second drug (see SI), further supporting the validity of the underlying rationale. 

In summary, our data demonstrate the utility of NCT for the non-invasive investigation of the mechanistic underpinnings of (altered) brain states and their transitions during cognition. Our data suggest that engagement of working memory involves brain-wide switching between activity states and that the steering of these network dynamics is differentially, but cooperatively, influenced by dopamine D1- and D2-receptor function. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants and study design 
  
All participants provided written informed consent for protocols approved by the Medical Ethics Committee II of the Medical Faculty Mannheim at the Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg, Germany. For the first study including healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia, we included a total of 202 subjects (178 healthy controls, 24 individuals with schizophrenia, Table  ). A trained psychiatrist or psychologist verified the diagnosis of schizophrenia based on ICD−10 criteria. 

For the second, pharmacological intervention study (Registration number: DRKS00005267 in the German Registry for Clinical Studies), 17 healthy individuals completed a subject- and observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized three-period cross-over study (Table  ). Participants were invited for a fixed interval of 7 days with each scanning session taking place at approximately the same time of day. On each of three scanning visits, individuals either received a single oral dose of 400 mg Amisulpride, 3 mg Risperidone, or Placebo. MRI scanning took place 2 h after drug administration, with the N-back paradigm commencing ~10 min after the start of the scan. One subject was excluded from the analysis due to an excessive body-mass index (BMI > 30). 


### Data acquisition 
  
#### fMRI 
  
For the first study in healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, BOLD fMRI was performed on a 3T Siemens Trio (Erlangen, Germany) in Mannheim, Germany. Prior to the acquisition of functional images, a high-resolution T1-weighted 3D MRI sequence was conducted (MPRAGE, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, FoV = 256 mm, TR = 1570 ms, TE = 2.75 ms, TI = 800 ms,   α   = 15°). Subsequently, functional data were acquired during performance of the N-back paradigm (for details, see supplemental material) using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following scanning parameters: TR/TE = 2000/30 ms,   α   = 80°, 28 axial slices (slice-thickness = 4 mm + 1 mm gap), descending acquisition, FoV = 192 mm, acquisition matrix = 64 × 64 128 volumes. The visual stimuli of the N-back paradigm were presented using Presentation (  https://www.neurobs.com  ). 

For the pharmacological intervention study, BOLD fMRI was performed on a 3T Siemens Trio Scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1790 ms, TE = 28 ms, 34 axial slices per volume, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm, 1 mm gap, 192 × 192 mm field of view, 76° flip angle, descending acquisition. Since the focus of this paper was on dynamical brain state transitions in the context of dopamine and working memory performance, other fMRI paradigms acquired in the pharmacological study are not reported here. These fMRI paradigms include an emotional face-matching paradigm (Hariri task), a reward anticipation paradigm (monetary incentive delay task), and a resting-state scan. These data were not analyzed here as the topic of this work was restricted to the study of brain network dynamics during working memory processing and the data from these tasks are not suitable for testing hypotheses pertaining to the working memory domain. Outcome parameters on working memory-related brain activity are reported in the supplemental materials. The pharmacological challenge study with amisulpride and risperidone is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) under the registration number DRKS00005267). There are currently no plans for reporting other outcome measures of this trial. 


#### Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
  
DTI data were acquired by using spin-echo EPI sequences with the following parameters: TR 14000 ms, TE 86 ms, 2 mm slice thickness, 60 non-collinear directions,   b  -value 1000 s/mm2, 1 b0 image, FOV 256 mm. 



### Connectome construction 
  
For the DTI data, the following preprocessing steps were performed with standard routines implemented in the software package FSL : (i) correction of the diffusion images for head motion and eddy currents by affine registration to a reference (b0) image, (ii) extraction of non-brain tissues , and iii) linear diffusion tensor fitting. After estimation of the diffusion tensor, we performed deterministic whole-brain fiber tracking as implemented in DSI Studio using a modified FACT algorithm . For each subject, 1,000,000 streamlines were initiated. Termination criteria included a maximum angle of 75 degrees and a minimal streamline length of 10 mm. We used a step size of 1 mm and did not apply smoothing. Streamlines with a length of <10 mm were removed . For the construction of structural connectivity matrices, the brain was parcellated into 374 regions (see  ). To map these parcellations into subject space, we applied a nonlinear registration implemented in DSI Studio. We estimated the structural connectivity between any two regions of the atlas by using the mean fractional anisotropy values between respective brain regions. This procedure resulted in a weighted adjacency matrix   A   whose entries   A   reflect the strength of structural connectivity between two brain regions. 

Because DTI data was not acquired during the pharmacological intervention study, we used the link-wise averaged connectivity matrix across all healthy subjects from study 1 to model the transition between individual brain states in the pharmacological intervention study . A comparison of the structural connectomes between groups can be found in Supplementary Table  . 


### Brain state definition 
  
Because we were interested in investigating how the brain controls and transitions between global brain states underlying circumscribed cognitive processes (such as those supporting working memory, attention, and motor behavior), we defined brain states as stationary patterns of activity during the execution of these processes. It is important to note that the temporal resolution of fMRI and the design of the N-back task limit the investigation of differential cognitive processes contributing to memory performance on fast time scales. Therefore, we cannot investigate the detailed temporal dynamics of working memory processes. However, our simplified design allows us to extract meaningful brain states elicited by a controlled cognitive process and therefore enables us to relate brain dynamics to cognitive function. Specifically, we defined individual brain states as spatial patterns of beta estimates associated with activity across brain regions of interest during both conditions of the N-back task . For that purpose, after standard preprocessing procedures in SPM12/8 (including realignment to the mean image, slice time correction, spatial normalization into standard stereotactic space, resampling to 3 mm isotropic voxels, and smoothing with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian Kernel) , we estimated standard first-level general linear models for the N-back task, separately for each individual. Except for the SPM version, both studies followed the same preprocessing procedure. These GLM models included regressors for the 0-back and 2-back conditions of interest, as well as the 6 motion parameters as regressors of non-interest. To define the brain activity pattern associated with each condition of the task, we extracted GLM (beta) parameter estimates for the 0-back and 2-back conditions separately  and we averaged them across all voxels in each of the 374 regions without applying any threshold. This procedure yielded a 374 by 1 vector for each condition (  x  ,   x  ) per subject representing how strongly the BOLD response in each brain region was associated with the working memory (2-back) or the motor control condition (0-back), respectively. These vectors (  x  ,   x  ) defined the final and target brain states for the following network control analyses. 


### Network control theory 
  
#### Optimal control theory framework 
  
To model the transition between 0-back and 2-back brain states, we used the framework of optimal control, following prior work  implemented in MATLAB. Based on individual brain states   X   = [  x  ,…  x  ] (in our case simplified to   n   = 2 states: 0-back and 2-back, see above) and a structural brain network   A   for each subject, we approximated the local brain dynamics by a linear continuous-time equation, To model the flow among task-related brain activity states. In the model,   x  (  t  ) is the state of the system at time   t  ,   A   is the wiring diagram of the underlying network,   B   denotes an input matrix defining the control nodes, and   u  (  t  ) is the time-dependent control signal . Note that while the initial state (  x  ) and the target state (  x  ) are empirically defined, any states of the system at other times are virtual intermediate steps in the trajectories of the state-space model. In that state-space, we aim to identify a trajectory between state   x   and state   x   that is minimal in terms of the necessary control input signals as well as the distance of the trajectory. This choice is motivated by two complementary ideas: first that the brain minimizes its energy expenditure to perform that transition and second, that optimal transitions between states should be non-random walk in state space. These notions can be formalized by defining an optimization problem that minimizes a given cost function. We define this cost function by the weighted sum of the energy cost of the transition and the integrated squared distance between the transition states and the target state. The problem of finding an optimal control input   u   *   that induces a trajectory from an initial state x  to a target state    x    reduces to the problem of finding an optimal solution to the minimization problem of the corresponding Hamiltonian : 

The parameter   ρ   in this equation allows to penalize the energy used by the optimal input in relation to the deviation from the optimal trajectory when solving for the optimal control. As we had no specific hypothesis that either of these elements of the cost function should prevail, we used the default of   ρ   = 1. 

By setting the input matrix   B   =   I  , the identity matrix, we allow all brain regions to be independent controllers . This is motivated by our analysis question to use a system-level and data-driven approach to identify regions contributing most to the transitions in an unbiased way in line with previous work . A description and discussion of the parameter choices, as well as additional analyses and discussion on the relation of control energy and fMRI activity measures can be found in the supplemental material. 


#### Control energy, stability, and impact 
  
Control energy for each node   k  ,   i   = 1, …, m (m = total number of brain nodes), was defined as i.e., the squared integral over time of energy input that the node has to exhibit to facilitate the transitions from the initial state to the target state . While the neurobiological foundations of control properties in the brain are not yet well understood, and our framework for defining control energy is based on a linear systems approach and cannot be directly related to the physical definition of the word energy (with joule as derived unit), this definition can be interpreted as the effort of a brain region needed to steer the activity pattern of itself and its connected brain regions into the desired final activation state, for example by tuning their internal firing or activity patterns by recurrent inhibitory connections. Accordingly, the total control energy for the entire brain was defined as the sum of all control energy across all nodes yielding one value for each transition per subject. To ensure a normal distribution of metric values for subsequent statistical testing, we applied a logarithmic transformation (base 10) to the control energy . 

From the control energy, we can also obtain the control stability and control impact. Stability was defined as i.e. the inverse control energy needed to   maintain   a state, or in other words, the control energy needed to go, e.g., from 2-back to 2-back . The rationale here is, that the energy required to maintain a state is inversely related to the distance of the state from a local minimum on the energy landscape. States that are distant from a local minimum will also dissipate quickly under spontaneous activity, while states at the local minimum will not. Thus, the temporal stability of a state is inversely related to the control energy required to maintain a state. For further details, we refer the interested reader to refs.  . To further investigate the influence that a single brain region has on the entire system’s dynamics during state trajectories, we computed the control impact of each node by iteratively removing one brain region from the network and re-computing the change in control energy . 


#### Suboptimal trajectories 
  
To investigate the energy landscape surrounding the minimum energy (in this sense ‘optimal’) trajectories, we quantified the variability of suboptimal trajectories by adding subtle random perturbation to the minimum energy trajectories over 200 iterations. Note that we employed a discrete-time dynamical system rather than a continuous-time system for these analyses, as discrete-time systems are computationally more tractable. To discretize our linear continuous-time system, we employed the following transformations and where   are the corresponding structural matrix and control input matrix in a discrete time system and   T   is the sampling time. As there is no prescriptive way to choose   T  , we estimated  , where   is the rise time of its fastest mode, i.e., the time that the system requires to go from 10 to 90% of its fastest step response. In the resulting discrete-time dynamical system at each discrete time step   t  , we applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to the cloud of suboptimal points to reduce dimensionality. Because the previous simulations show that the first PCA component explains more than 90% of variance, we continued by using the first component as a summary measure of suboptimal trajectories. To estimate the relative distance between suboptimal and optimal trajectories, we computed the percentage of variation of the maximum distance of the projected suboptimal points on the first principal component from the optimal one. This procedure resulted in a normalized measure giving the percentage of deviations for the 200 suboptimal trajectories from the optimal trajectory. Due to the heuristic nature of the algorithm applying a random perturbation, results can vary from run to run. Therefore, to increase replicability of our results, we repeated our analysis 10 times per subject (10 × 200 = 2000 suboptimal trajectories per subject). 



### Gene-based PCIs 
  
#### Genotyping, imputation, and quality control 
  
In this study, we used human genome data of 63 healthy subjects who were genotyped using HumanHap 610 and 660w Quad BeadChips. For all subjects, standard quality control (QC) and imputation were performed using the Gimpute pipeline (Chen, Lippold et al. 2018)  and the following established QC steps were applied. Step 1: Determine the number of male subjects for each heterozygous SNP of chromosome 23 and remove SNPs whose number is larger than 5% of the number of male samples. Step 2: Determine the number of heterozygous SNPs on X chromosome for each male sample, and remove samples that have the number of heterozygous SNPs larger than 10. Step 3: Remove SNPs with missing genotyping rate >5% before sample removal. Step 4: Exclude samples with missingness ≥ 0.02. Step 5: Exclude samples with autosomal heterozygosity deviation |Fhet| ≥ 0.2. Step 6: Remove SNPs with the proportion of missing genotyping >2% after sample removal. Step 7: Remove SNPs if the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test   P  -value was <1 × 10 . Step 8: PCA was applied to detect population outliers. Imputation was carried out using IMPUTE2/SHAPEIT , with a European reference panel for each study sample in each 3 Mb segment of the genome. This imputation reference set is from the full 1000 Genome Project dataset (August 2012, 30,069,288 variants, release “v3.macGT1”). The length of the buffer region is set to be 500 kb on either side of each segment. All other parameters were set to default values implemented in IMPUTE2. After imputation, SNPs with high imputation quality (INFO ≥ 0.6) and successfully imputed in ≥20 samples were retained. From the final well-imputed dataset with 63 subjects, we extracted 8 SNPs for DRD2 and 13 SNPs for DRD1 . For the subsequent genetic imaging analyses, we only used 64 subjects for whom all data modalities (DTI, fMRI, and imputed genome-wide SNP data) were available. 


#### Polygenic co-expression index calculation 
  
Recent publications have shown that gene sets defined using co-expression networks and selected for their association with the genes DRD1 and DRD2 provided replicable predictions of n-back-related brain activity and behavioral indices in line with the role of prefrontal dopamine in working memory . The gene sets have been previously identified using weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis [WGCNA ] applied on the Braincloud dataset (  N   = 199) of post-mortem DLPFC gene expression  resulting in 67 non-overlapping sets of genes based on their expression pattern. The co-expression gene sets including   DRD1   and   DRD2   were summarized into PCIs based on SNPs that predicted co-expression of these genes (called co-expression quantitative trait loci, or co-eQTLs). For the current analysis, we extracted the 13 SNPs linked to DRD1 and 8 SNPs linked to DRD2 expression as previously identified , and computed a weighted sum for both receptors similar to a genetic risk score computation for each individual. These PCIs scores served as a proxy of D1/D2 receptor expression in the DLPFC. 

For further details please see supplemental information. 



### Statistical inference 
  
Statistical inference was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24) and R (  https://www.Rproject.org/  ). All statistical comparisons were performed while controlling for age and sex and were tested two-sided. Because we were interested in control properties of brain state transitions independent of differences in the amount of mere activation, we controlled for the respective parameters reflecting the individual differences in activations in all analyses involving control properties. In particular, for all analyses involving stability measures, we additionally controlled for the average brain activity defined as the GLM parameter estimates over all regions in the 0-back and 2-back conditions. As the control energy of a transition depends highly on the absolute difference in the magnitude of the brain activity between its initial state and its final state (i.e., in our case the brain-wide activation difference between both task conditions) and as we were interested in the unique control properties independent of traditional activation differences, we additionally controlled for the difference in the mean brain activity in each analysis involving control energy. The difference in the mean brain activity was computed as the absolute average difference in the unthresholded GLM parameter estimates over all regions between 0-back and 2-back conditions. In all analyses involving polygenic scores for D1-/D2-expression, we further used the first 5 principal components from the PCA on the linkage-disequilibrium pruned set of autosomal SNPs to control for population stratification. Differences between control energy/stability of both conditions were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA with the condition as a within-subject factor. Drug effects were modeled using a repeated-measures ANOVA with drug and condition as within-subject factors. As healthy control and individuals with schizophrenia differed in one of the quantified DTI imaging quality parameters (tSNR, see Table  ), we also controlled for tSNR in each analysis involving both groups.

## Background 
  
The neural correlates of working memory (WM) impairment in schizophrenia remain a key puzzle in understanding the cognitive deficits and dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex observed in the disorder. We sought to determine whether patients with schizophrenia exhibit an alteration in the inverted-U relationship between WM load and activation that we recently observed in healthy individuals, and whether this could account for WM deficits in this population. 


## Methods 
  
Medicated (N=30) and unmedicated (N=21) patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (N=45) performed the self-ordered WM task during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We identified regions exhibiting an altered fit to an inverted-U relationship between WM load and activation that were also predictive of WM performance. 


## Results 
  
A blunted inverted-U response was observed in left DLPFC in patients and was associated with behavioral deficits in WM capacity. In addition, suppression of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during WM was reduced in patients, and was also associated with poorer WM capacity in patients. Finally, activation of visual cortex in the cuneus was elevated in patients and associated with improved WM capacity. Together, these findings explained 55% of the interindividual variance in WM capacity when combined with diagnostic and medication status, which alone accounted for only 22% of the variance in WM capacity. 


## Conclusions 
  
These findings identify a novel biomarker and putative mechanism of WM deficits in patients with schizophrenia, a reduction or flattening of the inverted-U relationship between activation and WM load observed in healthy individuals in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

## Introduction 
  
For several decades researchers have attempted to characterize the neurobiological mechanisms of deficits in working memory (WM) in patients with schizophrenia ( ), which have been closely linked to poorer functional outcomes ( ,  ). Performance on WM tasks depends on dopamine function in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; 4–7), which along with norepinephrine exerts a neuromodulatory influence on glutamatergic and GABAergic networks that are critical to WM representations ( ). Given the numerous dopaminergic abnormalities present in schizophrenia ( ,  – ) and the mounting evidence for a disruption in glutamate ( ,  ) and GABA ( ,  ) neurotransmission, disruption of WM representations in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia seems clear, although the precise nature of the disruption has yet to be elucidated. 

A widely used approach to assaying DLPFC function during WM performance has been non-invasive in vivo hemodynamic imaging using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Initial fMRI studies demonstrated reduced activation in DLPFC in patients during the performance of WM tasks ( – ), which was taken to be consistent with impaired dopamine function in DLPFC, given that dopamine in DLPFC had been shown to be critical for WM performance in non-human primates ( ,  ). However, subsequent studies failed to confirm these findings, instead showing greater DLPFC activation by patients ( – ), and our meta-analysis revealed no difference in DLPFC activation between patients and controls across 29 studies ( ). 

To account for these inconsistent findings, multiple authors proposed that the normal response of DLPFC to parametric variations in WM load may be non-monotonic (i.e. an ‘inverted-U’; 26–28), such that DLPFC activation declines at higher WM loads, while patients with schizophrenia exhibit a ‘left-shift’ in this inverted-U, leading to greater DLPFC activation at lower WM loads and reduced activation at greater loads. While this notion became prevalent and received considerable discussion (see, e.g.,  ,  ,  – ), thus far there has been no direct evidence to support it. Jansma and colleagues ( ) did observe a reduction in activation in DLPFC in patients from a 2-back to a 3-back load of the   n  -back task, but their finding has not been replicated in the very large literature using   n  -back tasks, was carried out with only 10 participants in each group, included error trials, and no inverted-U was observed in healthy participants. We propose that the failure thus far to demonstrate the hypothesized inverted-U may be due to the relative coarseness of the WM load manipulations allowed by commonly used WM tasks, such as the   n  -back and Sternberg tasks, where a limited number of steps limits the ability of the task to demonstrate an inverted-U. Consequently, we adapted the Self-Ordered WM Task (SOT), a classic neuropsychological test of DLPFC function ( ), for use with fMRI. Our version of the task allows for a gradual increase in WM load from 0 to 7 items in a single trial, and SOT performance correlates with performance on a visual change detection task ( ), the gold standard for estimating visual WM capacity. Critically, two independent cohorts of healthy individuals showed an inverted-U response to increasing WM load in the SOT in a network of regions including DLPFC ( ). 

Thus, we hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would exhibit a similar but left-shifted variant of this inverted-U. Moreover, we hypothesized that this would relate to task performance and WM deficit in patients. Consequently, we sought to determine whether either an inverted-U pattern of activation or the magnitude of activation (first in DLPFC, but also elsewhere in the brain) was 1) altered in patients with schizophrenia relative to matched controls, and 2) predictive of performance on the task, as only regions showing evidence of both 1 and 2 can be taken as putative neurobiological substrates explaining WM deficits in schizophrenia. Furthermore, as chronic dopamine-D2 receptor antagonism by antipsychotic medications may impact DLPFC function, we included both unmedicated and medicated groups of psychiatrically stable patients in our study. Consistent with our work in healthy individuals, we restricted analysis of DLPFC activation to correct trials, to limit the impact of poor performance, which has been shown to produce reduced DLPFC activation in patients with schizophrenia ( ,  ). 


## Methods and Materials 
  
### Participants 
  
All procedures were approved by the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) Institutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed consent, and patient participants were deemed to have capacity to provide consent by an independent psychiatrist. Patients were outpatients recruited from research facilities at NYSPI, and control participants were recruited via advertisements. The final sample included 21 unmedicated patients, 30 medicated patients, and 45 healthy control participants (see   for details). 

Inclusion criteria for patients were: (1) lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform disorder and (2) negative urine toxicology. Unmedicated patients were medication free for at least two weeks, while medicated patients were on stable doses of risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, paliperidone, or haloperidol for at least 4 weeks, with no antipsychotic polypharmacy and no psychiatric ER visit or hospitalization for at least 3 months. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were: (1) no history of DSM-IV Axis-I disorder; (2) no family history (first-degree) of psychotic illness; and (3) negative urine toxicology. Exclusion criteria for all groups included significant medical and neurological illnesses, current misuse of substances other than nicotine, pregnancy, and nursing. Groups were matched for age, gender, and parental socioeconomic status. See   for demographic and clinical data. 


### Task Procedures 
  
Task procedures are detailed in the  , and have been described previously ( ). Briefly, eight line-drawings of difficult-to-verbalize objects were presented, and participants were instructed to select each object once, in any order. After each object was selected, all objects were pseudo-randomly rearranged on the screen. Participants then had to select an object not already selected, so that at each step there was one more previously-selected object to remember. A perceptual and motor control task was used following identical procedures, except that one object was marked with an asterisk and participants were instructed to simply select the marked object. Participants were paid $0.25 per correct response for both tasks. Our primary measure of performance was WM capacity, as estimated by a maximum-likelihood model (see   and  ). 


### fMRI Procedures 
  
#### fMRI acquisition, preprocessing and first-level modeling 
  
Data was acquired on a Philips 1.5 Tesla Intera scanner and preprocessed as described elsewhere ( ) and in the  . Briefly, images were slice-timing corrected, motion realigned, normalized to a standard template, and smoothed. Time series values were transformed to percent signal change on a per-voxel basis. First-level modeling followed prior work (see   and  ). Regressors of interest were those reflecting correct trials in the control task or each of the first seven steps of the SOT, modeled separately. Step eight was excluded due to poor performance by patients. Incorrect trials were modeled separately and are not reported. 

Two primary outcome measures were calculated for each subject. First, the fit to an empirical inverted-U shape (obtained from an independent healthy sample; study 1 in 36) was calculated at each voxel for each participant. This fit was obtained by regressing observed task activation at each step on the inverted-U shape, such that larger positive values indicate better fit. Second, a task - control contrast was calculated as the average activation across the first seven steps of the SOT minus activation to the control task. Although we did not hypothesize a between-group difference in this contrast, it is a commonly used and straightforward measure of regional brain activation to the SOT relative to the control task. 


#### Second-level modeling 
  
Both outcome measures (regression betas indicating fit to the inverted-U pattern, and contrast values for overall activation) were analyzed in a series of robust models ( );   t  -tests for group comparisons or multiple regressions for testing effects of WM capacity and group, as appropriate. These models evaluated 1) whether there were group differences in activation or inverted-U fit, and 2) whether activation or inverted-U fit related to WM capacity in each group, and whether there were group differences in this relationship (group by WM capacity interaction). See   for multiple comparison corrections. 


#### Region of Interest 
  
Second-level analyses were first carried out in an anatomically- and functionally-defined a priori region of interest (ROI) of bilateral DLPFC (see  ), and subsequently in an exploratory whole-brain analysis. 




## Results 
  
### Task Performance 
  
Accuracy, reaction times, and estimated WM capacity are shown in  . Healthy participants had a mean (SD) WM capacity of 5.63 (1.32), consistent with prior observations ( ,  ), while patients had a WM capacity of 3.89 (1.93), which differed significantly from controls (  P  <0.00001). Unmedicated and medicated patients had WM capacities of 4.15 (1.88) and 3.72 (1.97) respectively (no significant difference;   P  =0.43). 

All groups performed above chance at every step (one-sample   t  -tests, all   P  <0.0001), and control participants performed better than patients at all steps (two-sample   t  -tests, all   P  <0.0001). Unmedicated patients performed better than medicated patients at step 2 (  P  <0.005) and showed a trend towards better performance at all other steps excluding step 7 (all   P  <0.1). Controls responded significantly faster than patients at all steps (all   P  <0.05) except step 2, at which a trend was observed (  P  =0.06). Patient groups did not differ in reaction time (all   P  >0.26). 


### fMRI Results 
  
#### Activation to the Self-Ordered Working Memory Task 
  
Regions showing significant differences in activation between the SOT and control task are reported in   and  . Patient subgroups are displayed for illustrative purposes, and between-group analyses are reported separately (below). Consistent with our prior report ( ), healthy controls showed robust activation of the classic WM network, including bilateral DLPFC, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and left dorsal anterior insula, as well as premotor areas and most of the lateral occipital lobe and fusiform gyrus. They also demonstrated substantial deactivations throughout the default mode network, including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior dorsal cingulate, precuneus, and lateral temporal lobes, as well as the temporal parietal junction. Both patient groups showed similar patterns of activation and deactivation to those observed in healthy individuals. 


#### Regions Exhibiting Inverted-U Activation Pattern 
  
Regions that significantly fit an inverted-U activation pattern are shown in   and  . Again, these regions closely matched those in prior work ( ), including bilateral DLPFC, PPC, pre-SMA, premotor areas, lateral occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, and medial temporal lobe in healthy individuals, with a similar but less robust activation pattern observed in both patient groups. 


#### Group Differences and Relationships to Performance in DLPFC 
  
A region of left DLPFC (141 voxels; MNI coordinates −48,15,28; max   t  -value 3.28) showed a poorer fit to an inverted-U in patients than in healthy controls (see  ). Activation in this region did not appear to be ‘left-shifted’ in the patient group; rather, patients failed to show the clear rise and fall of activation in this region observed in healthy individuals, leading to a flatter pattern of response. Moreover, in both patient and control groups we observed a positive relationship between inverted-U fit and WM capacity in left DLPFC, which overlapped with the region showing a group difference (see  ; controls: 109 voxels; MNI coordinates −51,15,31; max   t  -value 3.17; patients: 71 and 54 voxels; MNI coordinates −45,33,16 and −42,9,28; max   t  -values 3.24 and 3.42). Thus, the reduction in inverted-U fit in this region of left DLPFC can be considered a putative neurobiological marker of WM deficit in schizophrenia, as it is both deficient in patients and associated with WM capacity. No differences were observed within the DLPFC ROI between the two patient subgroups. 

Regions within the DLPFC ROI showing differences in overall activation to the task (relative to the control task) are shown in  . Briefly, inferior right prefrontal cortex showed greater activation in patients than controls, while a more dorsal and anterior area showed a positive relationship between activation and WM capacity in patients, but not controls. 


#### Whole-Brain Group Differences and Relationships to Performance 
  
The full set of regions showing significant group differences or relationships to performance in inverted-U fit or task activation are shown in   and  . We were primarily interested in identifying regions that exhibit   both   1) a group difference and 2) a relationship to WM capacity in either inverted-U fit or task activation, precisely like the left DLPFC region identified in the ROI analysis above, and consistent with a neurobiological substrate of WM deficit. Consequently, for both inverted-U fit and task activation we produced conjunction maps of regions showing both of these effects (1   and   2; see  ). This analysis recapitulated our ROI-based finding of a putative substrate of WM deficit in left-DLPFC for inverted-U fit, and further identified a region of mPFC which showed greater overall activation in patients and a negative relationship with performance in patient and control groups, demonstrating that failure by patients to adequately suppress activation in this region during task performance is associated with their deficit in WM. In addition, a region of visual cortex in the cuneus demonstrated increased activation in patients with schizophrenia, along with a positive relationship to WM capacity observed in healthy individuals (but not patients). 

In order to tease apart the relative, unique contributions of each of these findings to individual differences in WM capacity, we extracted mean values (either inverted-U fit betas or task - control contrast values, as appropriate) from each cluster (minimum 10 voxels) identified in the conjunction images shown in  . These were averaged within each cluster to produce a scalar value for each participant in each cluster, which was then related to WM capacity in a step-forward linear regression model selection framework (see  ). The impact of symptoms (the three PANSS subscales) on WM capacity were also evaluated in this framework. The resulting model demonstrated independent contributions to WM capacity from a) the inverted-U fit in the smaller left prefrontal cortex region, which behaved very similarly to the larger DLPFC cluster (see below), and was positively associated with WM capacity; b) precuneus, in which activation was positively associated with WM capacity; and c) the suppression of activation in mPFC, where activation was negatively associated with WM capacity in patients (but not controls). No symptom variables were significant. In addition, diagnosis still had a significant impact on WM capacity in the model, and a trend was observed toward further WM deficit in medicated patients. Moreover, all variables retained in the regression model were also significant predictors in bivariate simple linear regression models. All told, the model accounted for 55.5% of the variance in WM capacity, while a model with diagnostic information removed accounted for 37.9% of the variance in WM capacity. Critically, inverted-U fit in the larger left DLPFC region was correlated with the smaller region that remained in the model (r=0.57,   P  <0.00005), and if we substituted it into the model in place of the smaller region the model remained largely unchanged, although the P value for this region was then only at trend level (  P  =0.071). Taken together, these observations suggest that the contributions of the two left prefrontal regions in   were largely indistinguishable, though slightly more robust in the smaller of the two regions. 




## Discussion 
  
These data identify two potential neurobiological mechanisms of WM deficits in individuals with schizophrenia, one of which has not been previously identified in the literature. First, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated a flattening of the inverted-U pattern of activation over increasing WM loads observed in the DLPFC of healthy individuals, a pattern that was associated with reduced WM capacity. This represents the first clear demonstration of an alteration in the long-hypothesized inverted-U relationship between WM load and DLPFC activation in patients with schizophrenia, although the alteration we observed does not take on the form of a ‘left-shift’, as initially described ( – ). Rather, the flattening or blunting of the inverted-U observed here was proposed later, to explain findings of a reduced load-activation slope in patients relative to controls ( ), although no inverted-U was observed directly in that study. Second, patients demonstrated a relative failure to deactivate mPFC during WM task performance, which was also associated with greater deficits in WM capacity among patients with schizophrenia. This failure to deactivate portions of the so-called default-mode network by patients with schizophrenia has been widely reported ( – ), although we are aware of only one prior report linking deactivation of this region to WM task performance, in healthy individuals (but not patients; 43). Finally, activation in medial visual cortex (precuneus) was both significantly increased in schizophrenia and positively associated with WM capacity. Critically, multiple regression indicated an independent role for each of these three mechanisms in WM deficits. Moreover, these findings were obtained in an analysis using only task steps that were performed correctly, mitigating contamination of fMRI activation measures by trials on which participants were disengaged or otherwise unable to effectively utilize their WM. 

Despite tremendous interest in DLPFC dysfunction as the (putative) primary neuropathological substrate of WM deficits in schizophrenia, clear evidence for a functional abnormality in this region that is associated with individual differences in WM capacity has failed to emerge until this report, and confidence in our finding is enhanced by the (relatively) large sample employed here, and by the inclusion of a substantial number of medication-free patients. While the present results cannot speak directly to the molecular underpinnings of WM deficits in schizophrenia, and would certainly benefit from replication, here we report a direct connection between DLPFC dysfunction and WM deficits in schizophrenia in a clinical sample. Critically, this dysfunction does not come in the form of simply increased or decreased activation, but rather in a more subtle alteration of an activation pattern associated with strong WM capacity across diagnostic groups, which can (presumably) only be elucidated under conditions that allow for fine-grained manipulation of WM load over a broad WM loads; namely, a failure to show a robust inverted-U relationship between WM load and activation in left DLPFC. This has important implications for future work, which will be needed to better understand how this functional alteration in inverted-U activation in DLPFC operates in clinical samples and animal models, and which could potentially identify new targets for treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. That is, the overwhelming majority of WM tasks that have been used to probe WM in both clinical and basic research employ at most two or three WM loads, which is likely insufficient to characterize the inverted-U activation pattern (or lack thereof) shown to be associated with WM capacity in the present study. 

A critical unresolved question relates to the functional significance of the inverted-U observed in healthy controls, which we have discussed at some length elsewhere ( ). The initial formulation of the inverted-U hypothesis ( ,  ) speculated that it may occur as a result of task disengagement, which is an unlikely explanation for the present findings given that we analyzed only correctly performed trials, and that reaction times increase at higher loads even in poor performers ( ). Moreover, the positive association between the inverted-U pattern and WM capacity observed also suggests that this activation pattern is adaptive. Although we are at present unable to definitively adjudicate between competing possibilities, in general terms it seems most likely that the inverted-U reflects an adaptive shift in cognitive strategy that patients (or at least many patients) fail to engage. For example, as we have argued elsewhere, participants may gradually shift from a WM-mediated to a long-term memory mediated strategy that requires less reliance on active maintenance ( ). In this case, the failure by patients to exhibit this neural response could reflect inefficient strategy use, direct impairment to the WM system that limits the extent of DLPFC activation (thereby flattening the inverted-U), impairment in long-term memory that renders a strategy switch maladaptive, or impairment in whatever mechanism initiates such a switch. All of these possibilities bear careful consideration in future work specifically designed to determine the mechanism and functional significance of this inverted-U. 

In addition to the finding in DLPFC discussed above, an unhypothesized potential substrate of WM deficit in schizophrenia was identified in the mPFC. This region of the so-called default mode network has been linked to self-referential thought in studies of social cognition ( – ) as well to auto-biographical memory retrieval ( – ), suggesting that its association with poor WM capacity when activation of the region is not fully suppressed by patients during the SOT may reflect a failure to fully suppress task-irrelevant, self-referential or autobiographical cognition during WM task performance in individuals with schizophrenia. We also observed a region of the precuneus which was activated more by patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls, but which also showed a positive association between activation and WM capacity. While we can only speculate as to the precise implications of this finding, it is consistent with a compensatory mechanism in at least some patients, such that in spite of deficits in WM capacity, at least some gains were possible due to (or were indexed by) increases in activation in downstream visual cortical regions representing the task stimuli. 

In our view, this work highlights the critical importance of linking observed differences in neural activity (or BOLD signal) between patients and healthy individuals with measurable non-neural outcomes, such as task performance, cognitive deficit, or clinical symptoms. Without such a link (even one that is only correlational), observations such as the widely reported reduction in activation of DLPFC during WM task performance in patients with schizophrenia are difficult to interpret. If such a reduction is not clearly linked to poorer performance, which it is not in the large majority of the literature, it cannot be concluded that such a finding is related to cognitive deficits or WM impairment; indeed, it could be epiphenomenal to some other disease process that is not relevant to the process being studied. Here we observed no relationship between the overall level of activation in DLPFC and WM capacity in either healthy individuals or patients with schizophrenia, consistent with the literature, although the   pattern   of activation across loads within DLPFC was predictive of capacity. This is suggestive of a   dynamic   process that may depend more on the ability to flexibly alter the neural processes brought to bear on a behavioral goal in the course of a single trial than it does on the ability to produce a large increase in BOLD signal in a region thought to carry out executive control processes. In our view, the field should strive to move away from simply describing alterations in BOLD signal in patient samples, and attempt to rigorously characterize biomarkers of WM or other cognitive deficits, such as those described here. Once a biomarker has been established, and ideally replicated, researchers can then attempt to characterize other cognitive, neural, molecular, or genetic mechanisms associated with the biomarker and ultimately attempt to identify interventions (pharmacological or otherwise) that target the biomarker and could potentially produce improvements in WM or other cognitive deficits. 

As a final note, it is important to bear in mind that our two patient samples were identified more naturalistically than experimentally. Our unmedicated group consisted of psychiatrically stable outpatients who either refuse to take medications or were off medications for reasons unrelated to this study. Thus, they represent a population that is distinct from our medicated sample in ways that extend beyond medication status, and so any differences (or similarities) cannot necessarily be attributed to the medications per se. For example, the close correspondence in overall symptomatology between the two groups (see  ) strongly suggests that our unmedicated sample is more mildly psychotic than our medicated sample. Similarly, there was considerable suggestive (i.e. trend-level) evidence that the medicated group may have performed more poorly on the SOT than unmedicated patients. While, if real, this could plausibly be an effect of antipsychotic medications, it could also reflect more serious impairment in the medicated group. Thus, while the lack of differences between patient groups in any of our neural outcome measures or the observed relationships between neural outcomes and WM capacity suggests that the phenomenon under consideration are not strongly impacted by antipsychotic medication, it remains possible that these medications do exert important influences that have been missed here as a result of other systematic differences between these two groups.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Working memory (WM) deficits predict clinical and functional outcomes in schizophrenia but are poorly understood and unaddressed by existing treatments. WM encoding and WM retrieval have not been investigated in schizophrenia without the confounds of illness chronicity or the use of antipsychotics and illicit substances. Moreover, it is unclear if WM deficits may be linked to cannabinoid 1 receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia. Sixty-six volunteers (35 controls, 31 drug-free patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) completed the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm during an fMRI scan. Neural activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval was indexed using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent hemodynamic response. A subset of volunteers (20 controls, 20 drug-free patients) underwent a dynamic PET scan to measure [ C] MePPEP distribution volume (ml/cm ) to index CB1R availability. In a whole-brain analysis, there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the superior parietal lobule during WM encoding, and the bilateral hippocampus during WM retrieval. Region of interest analyses in volunteers who had PET/fMRI indicated that there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC, left ACC during encoding; and in the bilateral hippocampus, striatum, ACC and right DLPFC during retrieval. Striatal CB1R availability was positively associated with mean striatal activation during WM retrieval in male patients (  R   = 0.5,   p   = 0.02) but not male controls (  R   = −0.20,   p   = 0.53), and this was significantly different between groups,   Z   = −2.20,   p   = 0.02. Striatal CB1R may contribute to the pathophysiology of WM deficits in male patients and have implications for drug development in schizophrenia.

## Introduction 
  
Verbal working memory (WM) deficits are a stable component of the cognitive deficit seen in schizophrenia [ ] that predict poor clinical [ ] and functional outcomes [ ]. However, the neurobiology underlying WM impairments remains poorly understood and unaddressed by current treatments [ ]. Identifying the pathophysiology underlying impairments in WM is therefore important for the development of pharmacological treatments targeting WM deficits in schizophrenia. 

WM, the temporary storage and manipulation of information, is comprised of distinct processes including encoding, maintenance and retrieval [ ]. Studies using the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm (SIRP), able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, have shown that healthy volunteers show greater task-dependent blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during WM encoding in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, left hippocampus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral parietal cortex; and greater BOLD signal during WM retrieval in the bilateral parietal cortex, bilateral ttemporal cortex and the posterior cingulate [ ]. 

While numerous studies have investigated WM in schizophrenia [ ], few studies have used paradigms that are able to investigate WM encoding and retrieval mechanisms separately [ – ], and those that have, typically fail to model them separately [ – ] or do not report findings for both WM encoding and retrieval [ ]. While one study investigated WM encoding and retrieval in anti-psychotic-treated, male patients with chronic schizophrenia [ ], groups were not matched on performance. 

In this context, anti-psychotic treated patients relative to controls showed lower activation during WM encoding in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, but greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus, left striatum and the right inferior and frontal gyri [ ]. However, it is unclear if group differences [ ] may be related to the effects of anti-psychotic medication, substance use, illness chronicity or poor task engagement. 

Mice deficient in cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) on GABAergic interneurons exhibit WM deficits [ ]. Moreover, alterations in peripheral CB1R mRNA levels have been associated with poor cognitive performance [ ]. We recently showed that patients with schizophrenia show fewer cortical CB1Rs, where lower levels are associated with poorer cognitive functioning [ ]. Moreover, medication-naïve FEP patients, who do not use cannabis, show greater levels of the endogenous CB1R agonist, anandamide [ ], shown to impair memory retrieval in rodents [ – ]. 

We aimed to investigate the neural basis of both WM encoding and WM retrieval, and their relationship to CB1R availability. We predicted that patients relative to controls would show lower CB1R availability [ ,  ] and altered functional activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval [ ]. Taking together findings that CB1R modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity underlying memory [ – ] and literature showing an association between CB1R availability and behavioural measures of cognition in schizophrenia [ ], we predicted that CB1R availability would be associated with the neural correlates of WM. 


## Methods 
  
### Design 
  
A cross-sectional design was used. The neural correlates of WM were investigated in males and females, as well as males alone. Due to sex differences in CB1Rs [ ], we investigated CB1Rs in males, with the view of investigating females in future. The PET data, but not the fMRI or PET-fMRI relationships, were recently reported [ ]. 


### Participants 
  
Sixty-six volunteers including 31 patients with drug-naïve/free first episode psychosis (FEP) (mean [SD], age, 26.64 [4.68] years; 26 males, 5 females) and 35 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 27.12, [5.32] years; 26 males, 9 females) matched on age (age ±3 years) and sex were included. Patients were recruited from early intervention services for psychosis and healthy volunteers were recruited via local advertising in London, United Kingdom. A power calculation indicated that a sample size of 20 volunteers per group would have >80% power to detect a relationship of   R   = 0.35,   p   < 0.05 (two-tailed) (see supplementary for full details). 


### Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
  
Patients met the following criteria: (1) <3 years of illness onset; (2) mental capacity to consent; and (3) diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder [ ]. Healthy volunteers met the following criteria: (1) no current/lifetime history of an Axis I disorder, as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID) [ ]; (2) and no family history (first/second-degree) of an Axis I disorder [ ]. 

Exclusion criteria for all volunteers were as follows: (1) current/lifetime history of substance abuse/dependence, as determined by the SCID [ ]; (2) substance use within the last month; (3) positive result on a urine toxicology test detecting THC metabolites for up to 30 days (50 ng/ml cut off) or a positive result on a test detecting cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis, opiates and benzodiazepines; (4) head injury leading to loss of consciousness; and (5) contraindications to MRI safety. 


### Measures 
  
#### Clinical and demographic variables 
  
Age, sex, ethnicity, current/previous alcohol, nicotine and illicit substance use, age of illness onset/duration were recorded. Clinical symptom severity was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) [ ]. 


#### Neuroimaging 
  
##### Sternberg Item-Recognition Paradigm (SIRP) 
  
High-resolution T1-weighted images and the SIRP were acquired on a General Electric MR750 3.0 tesla scanner (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). The SIRP, shown to have good reliability [ ], was used to investigate WM [ ]. The task comprised of (1) encoding trials, where volunteers were instructed to memorize sets of letters; (2) retrieval trials, where volunteers indicated whether they had seen the letters previously; and (3) rest trials (see supplementary materials for details and Supplementary Fig.   for a paradigm schematic). 


##### Cannabinoid 1 receptor availability 
  
As reported elsewhere [ ], a CB1-selective radiotracer, [ C]MePPEP using arterial blood sampling, was used to measure CB1R availability [ ] (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). 




### Statistical analyses 
  
Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; Version 22) [ ]. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro−Wilk test; and equality of variances were assessed using the Lavene’s test. 

#### Behavioural data analysis 
  
Group differences in categorical and continuous variables were determined using chi-square and independent samples   t   tests, respectively. 


#### fMRI analysis 
  
Data were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM-12; Version 6684) [ ] using Matlab 8.5 [ ]. Frame-wise displacement was calculated used methods described previously [ ]. High velocity motion spikes were regressed out by including scan nulling (censoring) regressors for volumes with volume-to-volume frame-wise displacement greater than 0.5 mm. A standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was modelled using an event-related design where a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) was convolved with regressors encoding the onset and duration for the following ten conditions: encoding load (EL) 1, EL 3, EL 5, EL 7, EL 9, retrieval load (RL) 1, RL 3, RL 5, RL 7, and RL 9. Rest trials were left un-modelled and served as an implicit baseline. Individual fixed-effects analyses were performed for each participant to identify regional differences in relative activation using the following linear contrasts of parameter estimates: EL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1 and RL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1. To investigate group differences in the neural correlates of WM, a 2 (group: patient vs. control) × 4 (load: 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1) ANOVA was conducted for encoding and retrieval, respectively, controlling for age, sex and mean frame-wise displacement. Independent samples   t   tests were also used to investigate group differences in (1) mean frame-wise displacement and (2) task response accuracy (% of overall correct responses). 

Whole-brain analyses were conducted using the full sample (  N   = 66) including males and females, as well as males only (  N   = 52). Whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were repeated in male volunteers (  N   = 40) who had PET/fMRI, in order to permit the investigation of the association between CB1R and the neural correlates of WM in the same volunteers. ROI analyses were conducted for the ACC, hippocampus and striatum, defined using a standard probabilistic atlas [ ]. Since this atlas [ ] does not include the DLPFC, ROI analyses conducted for the DLPFC were defined using Brodmann areas 9 and 46 [ ] using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox (  http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas  ). These ROIs were selected based on findings that WM encoding activates the bilateral ACC, striatum, hippocampus and DLPFC in controls [ ] and findings indicating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ] and medial prefrontal cortex impair memory in rodents [ ]. 

A result was deemed significant if it survived family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of the peak-level extent (pFWE < 0.05). Mean BOLD signal was extracted using the MarsBar toolbox (  http://marsbar.sourceforge.net  ) using independently derived ROIs [ ]. Mean BOLD signal for encoding and retrieval trials were extracted for whole-brain grey matter, defined using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox (  http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas  ) in order to investigate data normality and equality of variances. 


#### PET analysis 
  
A standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). CB1R availability was indexed using the distribution volume (  V  ) of [ C]MePPEP using the Logan graphical method with a metabolite-free arterial plasma input function [ ]. CB1R availability was investigated in the same ROIs that were used for the fMRI ROI analyses. A 2 (group) × 4 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate group differences in CB1R availability. 


#### PET and fMRI analyses 
  
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the association between CB1R availability and (1) performance accuracy; and (2) the linearity of the load-dependence of the BOLD response during WM encoding and WM retrieval (for each subject, we fitted a linear regression model (intercept and slope) and took the slope as our measure of linearity of the BOLD response, as a function of task difficulty (separately for encoding and retrieval)). Bonferroni corrections were applied. Levels of statistical significance were   p   < 0.05 for all tests (two-tailed). 




## Results

### Sternberg Item-Recognition fMRI Paradigm 
  
#### Performance 
  
There were no significant group differences in performance accuracy on load 1 (t(64) = 1.44,   p   = 0.15) or 7 (t(64) = 1.95,   p   = 0.06) but there were group differences on loads 3 (t(64) = 2.32,   p   = 0.024), 5 (t(64) = 2.69,   p   = 0.01) and 9 (t(64) = 2.70,   p   = 0.01). These findings did not survive Bonferroni corrections. Relative to controls (M = 0.14 mm; SD = 0.07), patients (M = 0.21 mm; SD = 0.17) showed greater total frame-wise displacement (t(64) = −2.12,   p   = 0.04). 


#### fMRI analyses 
  
##### Data normality and equality of variance 
  
All fMRI data were normally distributed. There were no differences in the variances for fMRI data between groups (see supplementary table  ). 


##### Encoding 
  
In a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the left angular gyrus, left superior parietal lobe; and a significant main effect of WM load in the lingual gyrus and the posterior cingulate gyrus (see Supplementary Table  ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table  ). 

In a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the right middle temporal gyrus and frontal gyrus; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left superior parietal gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus (see Supplementary Table  ). In ROI analyses of encoding trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC and the left ACC; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left striatum, bilateral DLPFC and the bilateral ACC (see Table   for full results).

##### Retrieval 
  
In a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral hippocampus and the left posterior cingulate (see Supplementary Table  ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table  ). In a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the left hippocampus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral putamen, right anterior cingulate gyrus and the left caudate (see Supplementary Table  ). In ROI analyses of retrieval trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral striatum (see Fig.  ), bilateral hippocampus, right DLPFC and bilateral ACC (see Table   for results).

### CB1R availability 
  
Data were normally distributed. There was no difference in the variances between groups (see Supplementary Table  ). In a 2 (group) × 4 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA, there was a significant effect of group (F(1,38) = 4.61,   p   = 0.03) and region (F(1,38) = 27.43,   p   < 0.001). However, the group × load interaction was not significant (F(1,38) = 0.47,   p   = 0.50). 


### Association between CB1R availability and working memory 
  
There were no significant associations between performance accuracy and CB1R availability (see supplementary materials). However, male patients showed a significant positive association between striatal CB1R availability (see Fig.  ) and mean linear load-dependent responses of striatal BOLD signal during WM retrieval (  R   = 0.50,   p   = 0.02; see Figs.  – ) but male controls did not (  R   = −0.15,   p   = 0.53). However, neither of these findings survived Bonferroni corrections. The association in patients remained significant, when controlling for mean performance accuracy (  R   = 0.39,   p   = 0.04). However, this association fell short of statistical significance (  p   = 0.05) when restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans <10 days apart (see supplementary materials). There were no other significant associations (see Supplementary Tables  –  for full results).

## Discussion 
  
Our main finding was that male patients relative to male controls showed altered functional activation during WM encoding in the DLPFC, ACC and hippocampus and altered functional activation during WM retrieval in the DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus and striatum. Interestingly, the same male patients showed fewer cannabinoid 1 receptor levels in these brain regions relative to healthy volunteers. Moreover, male patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and load-dependent functional activation in the striatum during WM retrieval. 

Consistent with previous literature [ ], WM encoding was associated with greater task-related BOLD responses in the hippocampus and striatum. However, our finding that controls showed greater striatal and hippocampal activation during WM retrieval was not shown previously [ ]. Instead, greater task-related BOLD responses during WM retrieval in the parietal, temporal and cingulate cortices have been reported in controls [ ]. Since we used peak-level thresholding, this discrepant finding may be explained by the use of cluster-extent thresholding in this previous study, shown to have poor spatial specificity and increase false positive rates [ ]. 

Our finding that patients showed greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus and the left caudate in drug-free patients is consistent with findings in anti-psychotic-treated, chronic male patients [ ]. However, our finding extends this work by showing that drug-free/naïve FEP patients show altered activation during WM retrieval. Although our finding that patients show greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus during WM encoding is at odds with literature reporting decreased activation in this region during WM encoding [ ], this previous study showed group differences in performance accuracy which may indicate poor task engagement in patients [ ]. 

Our finding that patients showed lower CB1R availability in regions implicated in memory [ ] is consistent with previous work using arterial blood sampling [ ,  ], but is at odds with a study that failed to use arterial blood sampling [ ], necessary for the reliable estimation of the radiotracer kinetics [ ]. Our finding that patients show lower CB1R levels, in the context of functional alterations during WM, is consistent with literature demonstrating that CB1R-deficient mice exhibit WM deficits [ ,  ]. Moreover, our finding that CB1R levels were not associated with behavioural measures of WM is also consistent with literature showing that peripheral CB1R mRNA levels were not associated with WM [ ]. 

A recent meta-analysis indicated that central levels of CB1R agonist, anandamide, are elevated in patients with psychotic illnesses [ ]. Moreover, the acute administration of partial CB1R agonist, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, consistently induced WM deficits in healthy volunteers in a systematic review of 35 human studies [ ]. Previous work has also shown that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol induces greater WM deficits in schizophrenia relative to healthy individuals [ ]. While it is unclear if higher levels of endogenous CB1R agonists precipitate CB1R down-regualtion in psychosis, the chronic exposure to CB1R agonists, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, down-regulates CB1R levels in humans. Moreover, CB1R knockout mice, who are deficient in CB1R on GABAergic interneurons, show WM deficits [ ]. 

### Strengths and limitations 
  
A strength of the study was that patients were anti-psychotic naïve/free and satisfied criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, shown to have good diagnostic stability [ ,  ]. A limitation of our study, inherent to all cross-sectional designs, is that we are unable to determine if CB1R alterations are causally implicated in cognitive impairments. Future longitudinal studies using pharmacological interventions, that modulate CB1R availability, are needed to determine whether CB1R agonist-mediated reductions in CB1R availability [ ] induce WM impairments in humans. A limitation of the study was that CB1R availability was only investigated in male volunteers. Given sex differences in CB1R availability [ ] and sex differences in the behavioural and functional effects of cannabinoids on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity [ ], we specifically investigated the association between CB1R and WM in males to reduce the effect of sex as a source of variability. However, future studies are needed to determine if our findings generalize to female patients. 

PET and MRI scans were conducted as closely together as possible. However, due to limited scanner availability, these scans were approximately 1 month apart. Since test−retest data indicates that CB1R availability, as determined by the VT of [ C]MePPEP, remains stable between 1 and 309 days [ ], the delay between the two scans is unlikely to impact the variability of the VT. When restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans less than 10 days apart, we observed a trend-level association between striatal CB1R availability and mean linear load-dependent BOLD responses in the striatum during memory retrieval. This association is likely to have fallen short of statistical significance (  p   = 0.05) since the sample was statistically underpowered, in accordance with our power calculation. 

Since the endocannabinoid system dynamically changes in response to cannabis use [ ], we ensured that all subjects had negative urine drug screens prior to both scans and that subjects with current substance or a history of substance abuse/dependence were excluded. However, future studies should use simultaneous PET-fMRI scanners to improve the integration of multimodal imaging data. 

While some subjects had previously used cannabis, 1 month of abstinence normalizes CB1R levels [ ] and there were no associations between CB1R levels and prior cannabis use [ ]. Similarly, although tobacco use may influence CB1R levels [ ], there were no group differences in tobacco use or associations between CB1R levels and tobacco use [ ]. 

Although we were able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, WM maintenance was not modelled. Future studies could address this by imposing a longer delay between encoding and retrieval blocks. Although performance was not included in the model, the association between striatal CB1R availability and striatal fMRI BOLD responses remained unchanged when controlling for performance. However, this finding did not survive Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Moreover, while patients showed greater frame-wise displacement relative to controls, we controlled for frame-wise displacement in all fMRI analyses and thus, this is unlikely to be a significant confound. 

Given findings indicating that behavioural and functional measures of WM are associated with functional polymorphisms in the cannabinoid 1 receptor (  CNR1  ) gene [ ,  ], a limitation was that we were unable to investigate functional polymorphisms in the   CNR1   gene and how they may be linked to CB1R and WM in schizophrenia. 


### Implications for understanding the neurobiology of working memory deficits 
  
Our finding that patients show greater activation during both WM encoding and WM retrieval, in the context of no significant differences in performance, suggests that patients may utilize greater levels of neural activity to achieve levels of performance comparable to controls. 

Our findings show that WM encoding and WM retrieval processes are both altered in the early stages of schizophrenia without the confounds of substance use [ ] and anti-psychotic medication [ ]. Moreover, our finding that striatal CB1R availability is associated with altered striatal fMRI activation during WM retrieval in drug-naïve/free FEP patients extends preclinical literature demonstrating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum impair memory [ ,  ]. Since this association was exclusively shown in patients, but not controls, striatal CB1R dysfunction may precipitate an adaptation in the normal mechanisms underlying WM retrieval in the early stages of psychosis. 

Our finding that striatal CB1R availability was associated with striatal activation during WM retrieval may be due to the unique topographical organization of striatal CB1R. CB1R are densely distributed on GABAergic interneurons in the striatum, where they inhibit GABA release [ ,  ], a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition [ ]. By contrast, CB1R are predominately localized on glutamate neurons in the hippocampus [ ] and pyramidal neurons in the cortex [ ], where they inhibit glutamate release, a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of excitation [ ]. The regional specificity of our findings may therefore indicate that WM impairments in schizophrenia are linked to alterations in the disinhibition of synaptic transmission, arising from striatal CB1R dysfunction on GABAergic interneurons. This adds to other neurochemical evidence implicating the striatum in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [ – ]. 

Since CB1R regulate neurotransmitter release by inhibiting N-, P- and Q-type calcium channel openings and by activating inwardly rectifying potassium channels [ ], fewer CB1R may disrupt the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission underlying long-term potentiation [ ,  ]. These findings identify the CB1R as potential target for the treatment of WM impairments in FEP. 



## Conclusions 
  
Relative to controls, drug-naïve/free FEP patients exhibit functional alterations during WM encoding and WM retrieval. In contrast to controls, patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and mean load-dependent striatal functional activation during WM retrieval. These findings identify altered striatal CB1R availability and striatal neural correlates of WM retrieval in the pathophysiology of WM impairments in FEP.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Rationale 
  
Schizophrenia is associated with impairments in cognitive functioning yet there are no approved drugs to treat these deficits. 


## Objectives 
  
Based on animal models, we investigated the potential for roflumilast, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), to improve cognition, which may act by increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in brain regions underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. 


## Methods 
  
This study consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design involving 15 schizophrenia patients. In 3 treatment periods, patients were given 8 days of placebo or one of the two doses of roflumilast (100 and 250 μg daily) with 14 days of washout between treatments. The primary endpoints were dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation during a visuospatial working memory task measured with fMRI on dosing day 8 and verbal memory and working memory performance change from baseline to day 8. Least square mean change scores were calculated for behavioural outcomes; fMRI data were analysed in SPM12 with bilateral DLPFC as regions of interest. 


## Results 
  
Verbal memory was significantly improved under 250 μg roflumilast (effect size (ES) = 0.77) compared to placebo. fMRI analyses revealed that increasing dose of roflumilast was associated with reduction of bilateral DLPFC activation during working memory compared to placebo, although this was not statistically significant (ES = 0.31 for the higher dose). Working memory was not improved (ES = 0.03). 


## Conclusions 
  
Results support the mechanistic validation of potential novel strategies for improving cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and suggest that PDE4 inhibition may be beneficial for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

## Introduction 
  
Patients with schizophrenia commonly experience positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and negative symptoms such as lack of motivation and flattening of affect. In addition, patients also suffer from impairments in cognitive functioning, which are often profound and evident across a range of cognitive domains including learning, attention, memory and executive function (Heinrichs and Zakzanis  ). Despite the prevalence of these cognitive deficits, there are currently no approved treatments for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments are highly correlated with functional disability (O’Carroll  ; Green et al.  ) and in some domains to a greater degree than clinical symptoms (Bowie et al.  ), so there is a significant need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to improve cognition in these patients (Gilleen et al.  ; Gilleen  ). 

Many compounds and non-pharmacological techniques have been tested for their potential to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (Wallace et al.  ). While there have been some promising results, the dominant picture is of mixed findings and overall modest effect sizes. Pharmacological approaches include the use of agonist compounds, which may be useful in the short term, but present a theoretical limitation of adaptation of the neurotransmitter system or tolerance at the target receptor site. Compounds that indirectly alter target neurotransmitter systems may offer a more feasible approach. These include allosteric modulators, or those that inhibit enzymes, which breakdown components of neural signalling cascades. 

Recently, there has also been considerable interest in the potential for inhibitors of the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDEs) to improve cognitive functioning. PDEs are a large family of intracellular enzymes that hydrolyse the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cAMP plays an important role as a second messenger molecule controlling multiple cellular processes (Conti and Jin  ). Currently, 11 PDE families (PDE1–PDE11) have been identified that differ in substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors and expression in different cell types. Areas of high PDE localisation are widespread, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala supporting a role for these enzymes in cognition (Wallace et al.  ; van der Aart et al.  ). 

Within the PDE family, PDE4 holds specificity for cAMP and inhibition of this enzyme has demonstrated some potential for improving cognition. Rolipram, a highly selective inhibitor of PDE4 (Conti and Jin  ), which enhances intracellular availability of cAMP (Pérez-Torres et al.  ), has been shown to improve memory in rats (Barad et al.  ; Hosseini-Sharifabad et al.  ; Rutten et al.  ; Vanmierlo et al.  ) and reverse MK-801-induced (Zhang et al.  ) and scopolamine-induced (Egawa et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ) deficits in working memory, latent inhibition (Davis and Gould  ), as well as scopolamine-induced deficits in short-term memory (Imanishi et al.  ; Rutten et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). Rolipram attenuates PCP-induced impairments in object retrieval in monkeys (Rutten et al.  ), and cognitive flexibility in rodents (Rodefer et al.  ). Rolipram is a non-selective PDE4 inhibitor, and these effects may be due to the involvement of cAMP in memory as PDE4A, 4D and to a lesser extent 4C are expressed in rat hippocampal CA1 (Peng et al.  ). Rolipram increases cAMP response in hippocampal slices and serves to facilitate persistent long-term potentiation in CA1 (Barad et al.  ) and may do so by lowering the threshold at which LTP occurs (Bach et al.  ). 

In humans to date, there is no published assessment of the ability of rolipram to improve cognition, which may in part be due to its emetic side effects likely, in turn, due to its non-selectivity. Another PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast, currently used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has also shown potential to be a cognitive enhancer and has a more favourable side-effect profile perhaps attributable to its greater relative selectivity (for PDE4B/D). Although roflumilast has been used in fewer neurological studies than rolipram, the reported effects to date are favourable. Roflumilast (and rolipram) significantly reverses time-induced memory deficits in a novel object recognition task (Jabaris et al.  ) and also enhances spatial Y-maze performance in mice (Vanmierlo et al.  ). In healthy volunteers, Van Duinen et al. ( ) demonstrated that a single dose of 100 μg roflumilast improved verbal memory and P600 (late event related potentials) during verbal learning significantly more than placebo. Further, the same group reported that roflumilast improved verbal learning in elderly healthy volunteers (Van Duinen et al.  ). 

Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are broad and notably include prefrontal dysfunction in addition to hippocampal-dependent memories (Heinrichs and Zakzanis  ). Dopamine dysfunction has also been implicated in the frontally mediated deficits through the dopamine D1 receptor (Goldman-Rakic et al.  ). D1R binding in PFC is reduced in schizophrenia, and this reduction is associated with poorer cognitive performance (Okubo et al.  ). PDE4 can modulate dopamine signalling via its effects on cAMP, which is increased with dopamine D1 receptor agonism (Cooper  ). Indeed, PDE4 is co-expressed with DARPP-32 in D1 receptor-positive cortical pyramidal neurons and modulates the level of D1 receptor signalling and DARPP-32 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex (Kuroiwa et al.  ). As working memory is impaired in schizophrenia (Heinrichs and Zakzanis  ), is functionally subserved in part by prefrontal D1 (Goldman-Rakic et al.  ) and is disrupted by dysregulation of cAMP signalling (Taylor et al.  ), roflumilast may be expected to improve cognition via this pathway. 

In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that roflumilast, as an add-on to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), would improve working memory and episodic memory functioning in schizophrenia patients. We reasoned that the domains of working memory and verbal episodic memory, consistently impaired in schizophrenia, would be sensitive to modulation of PDE4 activity based on previous animal studies and the known role of cAMP in these processes. We included functional imaging of a working memory task to test the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex activity would be modulated by roflumilast, and to our knowledge, this is the first three-period crossover fMRI neuroimaging study designed to assess a cognitive enhancer in schizophrenia. We anticipated that roflumilast would enhance cognitive performance compared to placebo. Specifically, we hypothesised that there would be a significantly greater positive change in performance of verbal episodic memory (as measured by the HVLT) and working memory (as measured by the Spatial Span task), and significantly reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity during spatial working memory (as measured by the Dot Task with fMRI) following 8 days of treatment with roflumilast compared to 8 days with placebo. We also additionally explored dose-response effects of roflumilast for these cognitive and neural outcomes. 


## Method 
  
### Design 
  
This was a phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site, three-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of roflumilast as an add-on to SGA in attenuating cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. In each of the three periods, placebo and 100 or 250 μg roflumilast were administered once daily to patients with schizophrenia for eight consecutive days to achieve steady state (Fig.  ). The time course of study participation was consistent and conformed to Fig.   for all participants. All patients received all doses, and the treatment order was determined by random allocation to one of three treatment sequences according to a Latin Square design (ABC, BCA or CAB), with a 2-week wash-out between phases (see Table  ).

Treatment sequences 
  

Cognitive testing with the Hopkins verbal learning test-revised (HVLT-R) and spatial span (SS) from the MCCB MATRICS test battery (Nuechterlein et al.  ) was performed on the first (pre-drug on D1) and last day (D8 post-drug)   of each phase   to assess change in cognition, and fMRI was conducted on the eighth day of each phase (see fig.  ). One week   prior   to the first drug or placebo testing phase, all participants underwent two practice training sessions for the cognitive tests and an fMRI familiarisation session. Prior task administration is a standard approach to minimise, or ‘wash-out’, practice or learning effects. These effects were further reduced by using the five available parallel versions of the HVLT-R (forms 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6), and the order of HVLT form administration was randomised and counterbalanced across participants. The DOT task trial-set is randomly generated with each test administration. For the spatial span task, no parallel versions exist however as there was at least 7 days between assessments trial-specific retention (learning effects) would not be expected to occur for such complex spatial sequences. There were three outcome measures: change in accuracy on the HVLT-R, span on the SS and neural activity change during a spatial working memory test (the Dot Task (Marquand et al.  )) as measured with fMRI. Performance on the Dot Task was trained to achieve a 70% correct threshold, and only correct trials (hence   successful   working memory) were included in the analysis. FMRI was carried out while subjects performed the Dot Task in the MR scanner while the other cognitive tasks, the HVLT and spatial span task, were performed just prior and outside the scanner. 

This study took place at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London. This research was conducted in accordance with the protocol procedures complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 GCP guidance, and all applicable local or regional regulatory requirements. The study was pre-registered with   clinicaltrials.gov   (identifier:   NCT02079844  ), and hospital ethics approvals were given by NRES Committee South Central Berkshire (reference 12/SC/0443). 


### Participants 
  
Patients who had consented to be contacted about participating in research were recruited from local outpatient services. Following the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, men or women, aged 18 to 60 years, who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), criteria for schizophrenia, and who were receiving stable doses of second-generation antipsychotics for at least 2 months prior to screening (see   for inclusion/exclusion criteria) were eligible to take part. Twenty-one patients were consented and randomised to one of the treatment groups. Participants were randomised to one of three treatment sequences according to a blinded computer-generated allocation schedule. Six did not complete the study: five participants withdrew without reason, and one was unable to attend dosing and so was withdrawn. Demographics and clinical information for the 15 participants who completed are shown in Table  , and additional information on participants is shown in  . Only data from completers is reported. Seven participants were receiving olanzapine (2 at 20 mg, 2 at 10 mg, 1 at 15 mg, 1 at 10 mg, 1 at 2.5 mg), four were receiving aripiprazole (2 at 20 mg, 1 at 15 mg, 1 at 10 mg), one quetiapine 300 mg, one paliperidone 50 mg and two risperidone depot 25 mg.

### Dose 
  
It has been demonstrated that single doses of roflumilast 100 μg (but not 300 or 1000 μg) administration improves episodic memory in both healthy volunteers; with the same pattern—single dose 100 μg (but not 300 or 1000 μg)—showing significant effects on P600 values with EEG (24,25, 40). In following, 100 and 250 μg in multiple dosing to achieve steady-state condition were chosen for this study to explore the effective dose window in patients with schizophrenia. Dosing on all days took place at site in front of a research team member to ensure compliance—confirmed post hoc via pharmacokinetic/metabolite analysis of blood samples. Plasma concentrations, roflumilast exposure and safety data are reported in  . Both doses were compared to placebo. Blinding and randomisation procedures were conducted by Quintiles CRO Ltd. Blindings for this study were not broken for any participant. 


### Measures 
  
Two memory subtests from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB (Nuechterlein et al.  )) were administered: 

#### The Hopkins verbal learning test-revised (Brandt and Benedict  ) 
  
The Hopkins verbal learning test-revised (HVLT-R) is a subtest of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB (Nuechterlein et al.  )). It assesses verbal memory and consists of a list of 12 words from 3 taxonomic categories. The words were presented orally, and the participants are asked to recall as many words as possible after each of three trials. The key outcome variable for the HVLT-R was the total number of correct responses over three trials. The test was administered on day 1 (pre-drug) and day 8 (post-drug), and each drug period made use of the alternate HVLT-R forms from the MATRICS to avoid practice effects. 


#### The spatial span test (Wechsler memory scale 3rd edition; Wechsler  ) 
  
The spatial span test assesses working memory. Participants are presented with a board containing blue blocks arranged in an irregular pattern. The rater taps out a pattern on the blocks and participants are tasked with tapping the same pattern in response. Trial spans become longer in length and also consist of both forward and reverse patterns, the latter requiring patients to tap in the reverse order to the administrator. Scores are the sum of the correct responses in both the forward and backward trials. 



### fMRI 
  
#### The DOT task 
  
In the DOT task (see Fig.  ), a rewarded delayed-response working memory task (Marquand et al.  ), participants are instructed to remember the spatial location of a target stimulus (a dot) relative to a fixation cross after a delay period, which includes a noise mask (numerous moving dots). Half of the 40 trials carried a monetary reward, indicated by the colour of the stimulus, and the order of the trials was randomised and counterbalanced across subjects. In each trial, the target stimulus was presented for 750 ms (encoding), followed immediately by a mask for a further 750 ms to disrupt visual iconic memory; after a 7- or 9-s interval (delay), the target stimulus and a distracter stimulus are presented, and participants indicated which of the stimuli matches the target location by a left- or right-button press on a two-button response box (retrieval; 2 s). Feedback indicating success or failure is provided at the end of each trial. Patients received training on the task to ensure they understood the instructions, were able to respond appropriately and could achieve a threshold performance of 70% correct trials—well above chance. Only correct trials were used in the analysis as we were interested in successful spatial working memory (evident from correct trials only)—hence performance changes per se were not examined, only BOLD response changes during spatial working memory. FMRI was only conducted on D8 (post-drug), and these sessions were compared between drug arms. Strict criteria were used for acceptance of valid data available in all three sessions.

#### Symptom measures 
  
Symptoms were assessed at days 1 and 8 using the PANSS (Kay et al.  ), although the study design was focussed on, and powered for, the cognitive outcomes. 



### Statistical analysis 
  
Statistical analyses were performed to examine the effect of each dose of drug and placebo on change in cognitive test scores from day 1 (baseline) to day 8 (post-drug assessment) for the endpoints involving cognitive test results relative to change in the placebo phase from day 1 (baseline) to day 8 (post-drug assessment), and by day 8 comparison for the fMRI endpoints. Data processing and voxelwise brain image analysis was performed by the investigators, with the analysis of the primary endpoints performed by an independent statistician. 

#### Cognition 
  
Pairwise comparisons were made between each roflumilast dose level and placebo using LS means estimated via analysis of variance (ANOVA) with sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. The effect size for each roflumilast dose level was calculated using Cohen’s d from which an effect size of 0 to 0.2 is considered small, 0.3 to 0.7 is considered moderate, and ≥ 0.8 is considered large. 


#### fMRI 
  
##### MRI data acquisition 
  
We collected a high-resolution T1-weighted image on one session for each participant, for normalisation to a standard space (TR = 7312 ms, TE = 3.016 ms, FoV 270 mm, voxel size 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.2 mm, 196 slices, TI = 400 ms). The functional time series used the following parameters (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FoV 211 mm, voxel size 3.75 × 3.75 × 3.3 mm, 39 slices). 


##### fMRI and roflumilast 
  
The fMRI task data acquisition started 5 h after day 8 dosing. The Tmax is up to 3 h after ingestion of a single dose and its   N  -oxide metabolite demonstrates a plateau-like Tmax after about 8 h. The median effective half-life of roflumilast is 17 h. Steady-state plasma concentrations following repeated dosing with 500 μg Roflumilast is estimated to be reached after approximately 4 days (83 h) for roflumilast and after 6 days (148 h) for the   N  -oxide metabolite. Roflumilast and its   N  -oxide show linear repeated-dose pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 250 to 1000 μg. Thus, assessment after 8 days of treatment ensured steady-state plasma concentrations required for cognitive testing. 


##### fMRI modelling 
  
Preprocesing steps are reported in the  . Single-subject, single-session fixed-effects GLM analysis was conducted to model responses during the DOT task. The DOT task consists of three parts: encoding, delay and retrieval, and additionally, trials were either rewarded or unrewarded. Thus, the following regressors were modelled: non-rewarded encoding and delay, non-rewarded retrieval, non-rewarded feedback, rewarded encoding and delay, rewarded retrieval and rewarded feedback. Because of the proximity in time and the brief, fixed presentation time of the cues, the encoding and delay periods were modelled together. The six movement regressors from the motion correction were also included in the model. A high pass filter of a period of 128 s was applied to the model to eliminate low-frequency signals such as scanner drift. For the purposes of reporting the data here, contrasts for the encoding and delay period were combined across the rewarded and non-rewarded trials as the primary outcomes were based on working memory-related activity. 

The individual contrast maps from the first level were entered into a second level, random-effects analysis with subject as the random effect and session (drug/placebo) as a within-subject effect. Linear contrasts were used to describe the main effect of task across all drug conditions and the effect of roflumilast on the a priori defined region of interest. 

fMRI performed well across participants in relation to the cognitive task and data collected, although data from some were removed due to poor quality. Quality was assessed for the fMRI data by visually inspecting coverage within the field of view and calculating movement. Excessive movement (> 1 voxel > 20% volumes) in any one session resulted in removal of the participant from the fMRI analysis. A high response rate was required for the task (> 60%), and no participant was removed due to low response rate. 



#### Regions of interest (ROI) 
  
A dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) ROI was chosen due to its known involvement in working memory (Curtis and D’Esposito  ) defined as 6-mm spheres centred on the peak co-ordinates from Marquand et al. ( ) (Left − 43, 33, 25, Right 38, 44, 32), which utilised the same task. 




## Results 
  
### HVLT-r 
  
LS mean HVLT total scores on day 8 (compared to Day 1) were increased with roflumilast 100 and 250 μg (0.27 (SE = 1.06) and 1.07 (SE = 1.08), respectively) and decreased with placebo (− 1.67, SE = 1.08) (see Table  ). LS mean differences in change from baseline between high-dose roflumilast and placebo were statistically significant (  p   = .044, ES = 0.77 (large effect size)), but not between low-dose roflumilast and placebo (  p   = .14, ES = 0.55 (medium effect size)). We also conducted an ITT (Intention To Treat) analysis which revealed the following effects: 100 μg (  N   = 17) vs placebo (  N   = 16): ES = .45 (95% CI interval = − 0.25 to 1.14); and 250 μg (  N   = 16) vs placebo: ES = 0.55 (95% CI interval = − 0.16 to 1.26). These differences were not significantly different.

Post hoc examination of the three HVLT trials revealed that performance on the high-dose roflumilast and placebo was maximally different on the third and last recall test of the three HVLT-R word list repetitions (effect size for trial 1 = 0.32, trial 2 = 0.47, trial 3 = 0.73). 


### Spatial span 
  
LS mean total score change from D1 to day 8 with roflumilast 100 and 250 μg were 0.07 (SE = 0.51) and − 0.13 (SE = .52), respectively, while scores decreased with placebo (− 0.20, SE = 0.52). Change under both roflumilast doses were not significantly different to placebo (low dose   p   = .74; high dose   p   = .93). An ITT analysis (placebo:   N   = 16, 100 μg   N   = 17, and 250 μg   N   = 16) also revealed no significant drug effects vs placebo (100 μg (  N   = 17) vs placebo (  N   = 16): ES = 0.11 (95% CI interval = − 0.57 to 0.79), and 250 μg (  N   = 16) vs placebo: ES = 0.06 (95% CI interval = − 0.63 to 0.76). 


### fMRI 
  
#### The DOT task 
  
Complete data were acquired for ten participants. Participants were as evenly distributed across the treatment orders as possible. For the comparison of placebo with 100 and 250 μg, there was change of activity with effect sizes of − 0.03 and − 0.671, with   p   values of 0.948 and 0.154 respectively. A voxelwise analysis was additionally conducted, and this again showed a reduction in activity from placebo to 250 μg roflumilast (shown in Fig.  a, b) although this did not survive FWE-correction for multiple comparisons in the DLPFC. An additional exploratory whole-brain analysis was performed, and this revealed that no other brain regions were significantly affected by roflumilast; thus, no changes outside the DLPFC were observed. A separate analysis of the same data but including all 13 patients who completed the task (at any time point) showed effect sizes of − 0.006 for 100 μg (  p   = .98) and 0.500 for 250 μg (  p   = 0.082). The mean difference in BOLD response for the low and high doses is illustrated in Fig.  c. While these analyses are in line with our prediction of reduced activity in the DLFPC with roflumilast, the differences were not significant. Post hoc analyses of the rewarded and unrewarded trials separately showed the same pattern of results: less activity associated with the high dose, most with placebo and the low dose producing intermediate activity. Behaviourally, as participants were trained to perform well on the task (to a threshold of ~ 70%) and only correct trials were used in the analysis performance was intended to be matched across treatment arms. As shown in Table  , this was the case, and differences were not statistically different.

## Discussion 
  
This study tested the hypothesis that the addition of roflumilast, a PDE4 inhibitor, would improve cognitive function and modulate frontal brain activity in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics. The performance on verbal learning from the HVLT was significantly improved with the higher dose of roflumilast compared to placebo; however, working memory measured with the spatial span test did not show improvement. Reductions in PFC activity during working memory were evident with increasing doses of roflumilast in bilateral DLPFC, and the effect size for the higher dose was 0.5. 

### Verbal learning 
  
There is considerable preclinical evidence suggesting that inhibition of the PDE4 enzyme improves cognition, particularly memory processes (Bach et al.  ; Barad et al.  ; Hosseini-Sharifabad et al.  ; Rodefer et al.  ; Rutten et al.  ; Rutten et al.  ; Rutten et al.  ; Vanmierlo et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). Performance on verbal list learning was significantly enhanced by roflumilast in patients with schizophrenia—and these effects were greatest on the third and final learning presentation. Strikingly, Van Duinen et al. ( ) have also recently reported improvement in verbal learning performance following a single-dose 100 μg of roflumilast in healthy adults—and also showing greatest effects on the third trial in healthy adults as demonstrated here. The P600 peak as measured by EEG during verbal learning was also significantly increased, again only on the third trial at 100 μg, not at 300 or 1000 μg, of roflumilast. The authors suggest these findings may indicate that roflumilast affects information processing during memory (word) encoding. 

There is now emerging and converging evidence that PDE4 inhibition can enhance memory via its action on long-term potentiation (LTP). Rolipram specifically induces late-phase LTP (L-LTP) not early-phase LTP (E-LTP) in rat hippocampus (Barad et al.  ), and similarly specifically modulates late-long-term memory (LTM) not early-LTM (Rutten et al.  ). It has been proposed that increasing cAMP signalling may improve memory by raising the probability that long-lasting synaptic plasticity occurs (Barad et al.  ; Blokland et al.  ). In line with this, mice with impaired long-term object recognition, due to being carriers of truncated CREB-binding protein, show reversal of deficits with rolipram (Bourtchouladze et al.  ). In humans, the hippocampus is active during memory, which requires longer-term storage, including verbal learning (Johnson et al.  ). Thus, as potential for LTP will be maximal with an increased number of stimuli presented over a time period, elevation of L-LTP/L-LTM by roflumilast is a potential neurobiological mechanism by which verbal learning performance improvements may occur. 


### Working memory 
  
Roflumilast was associated with reduced cortical demands during spatial working memory assessed using fMRI. This modulation was dose-dependent with a medium effect size for the higher dose, suggesting improved neural efficiency. We proposed that roflumilast would improve working memory as PDE4 inhibition increases intracellular cAMP levels in striatum and frontal cortex. These alterations increase dopamine synthesis and turnover in striatum and enhance the dopamine D1 receptor/PKA/DARP-32 signalling cascade in frontal cortex. Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram increases dopamine D1 receptor signalling in cortical pyramidal neurons (in mouse) in frontal cortex (Kuroiwa et al.  ), and dopamine D1 receptor signalling is known to improve working memory performance in rodents and non-human primates (Goldman-Rakic et al.  ). The preclinical evidence also indicated that PDE4 inhibition reverses MK-801-induced (Vanmierlo et al. 2006) and scopolamine-induced (Egawa et al.  ) deficits in working memory. As an example, activation of NMDA receptors produces a CA2-dependent increase in cAMP that may play a role in the induction of LTP in CA1 of the hippocampus (Zhang et al.  ). 

Roflumilast did not, however, lead to significant change in cognitive performance on spatial span compared to placebo at either dose. The pattern of data in the prefrontal cortex fits with previous neuroimaging studies of catecholaminergic stimulant medication (e.g., Mehta et al.  ) with reductions in task-related activity accompanied by improvements, or even lack of significant change in performance. Future studies could investigate the specific PDE4 neurotransmitter interactions, which may account for pro-cognitive effects of PDE4 inhibition in working memory, changes in neural efficiency, and other cognitive processes. 


### Limitations 
  
The main limitation of this mechanistic study was the relatively low subject numbers, partly due to attrition because the patients found the frequency and complexity of assessments within the study somewhat demanding. As this study is exploratory in nature, the sample size was not based on statistical considerations. The sample size is based on the desire to gain adequate efficacy data on the primary and secondary outcomes as well as on published literature reporting pro-cognitive effects of drug candidates using the same pharmacological model and similar study. However, using a within-subject, crossover design rescues some statistical power by reducing degrees of freedom. 

A primary goal of the study was to provide evidence of improved cognitive function following PDE4 inhibition in patients for the first time, and to assess the underlying impact on frontal brain activation, In both respects, it was successful and demonstrates the utility of combining cognitive and imaging markers in studies of novel mechanisms in patient populations. Since the outcomes were only measured at one time point, we are unable to determine if the drug effects are in fact greater earlier after an acute medication administration, or alternatively, if longer-term treatment leads to more robust effects in patients. 

The delayed-response working memory fMRI task was based on one of the most widely used working memory paradigms, is sensitive to pharmacological manipulation and incorporated reward and no-reward conditions in order to parallel both the human and animal research into working memory processes. This also allows for secondary analyses to examine the role of reward; however, there was no differential effect of roflumilast on reward. This could reflect either a real lack of effect, or poor sensitivity due to the low sample size. 

Additionally, for the purposes of this initial trial, we minimised the number of endpoints and chose to examine only the DLPFC during administration of the DOT task as this aligned with the predicted effects in schizophrenia and the predicted effects of PDE4 inhibition on the prefrontal activation seen during the encoding and delay periods on the task; however, subsequent work could investigate additional brain regions. 

The age at illness onset ranged from 17 to 44 years, and the mean age of participants was 32 years old which is relatively later than in other patient studies. An older average age of patients is, however, more likely to be expected in drug trials as clinical and medication stability are inclusion criteria, and this is somewhat more likely in older patients. Despite this, the higher mean age may also be due to the relatively small sample size and could potentially limit the generalizability of the findings to younger onset samples. 

The significant mean score differences between high-dose roflumilast and placebo on the HVLT-R were contributed to in part by a decline over time in the placebo arm. Despite this, the trend from placebo to high dose was significantly greater improvement with the high dose than placebo. Decline in the placebo group may additionally be attributable to study fatigue, which may be modified in the treatment periods. 



## Conclusions 
  
Individuals with schizophrenia have significant cognitive deficits across many domains of functioning including memory, learning and working memory. Improvements in cognitive functioning are associated with better overall outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia (Bowie et al.  ), yet there are no currently approved drugs for the improvement of cognition in schizophrenia. This study investigated the potential for roflumilast, a PDE4 inhibitor, to provide pro-cognitive effects in patients with schizophrenia concurrently treated with second-generation antipsychotics. The results showed that high-dose roflumilast significantly improved verbal learning relative to placebo. There was also a trend for roflumilast decreasing activation in the DLPFC during working memory suggestive of an impact via improving neural efficiency. These results are in line with previous studies with experimental animals indicating that PDE4 inhibition may improve memory function through its impact on intracellular mechanisms. Memory may be enhanced via the effects of cAMP on two systems—one, fast-acting on prefrontal neurotransmission to improve online memory processes, and a second, enhancing the capacity of L-LTP to encode learning targets (Kuroiwa et al.  ). In summary, this clinical study provides support for increasing the use of combined neuroimaging and cognitive testing to validate models developed in experimental animals. We suggest that this research also supports further evaluation and clinical trials of this well-tolerated, off-patent and widely prescribed treatment as a potentially repurposed medication from respiratory medicine to neuropsychiatry. It should also be noted for subsequent studies that cAMP gradients and responses are highly varied among PDE isoforms (Fertig and Baillie  ); thus, future work may better couple specific targeting of PDE4 subtypes with cognitive effects, potentially avoiding the need for multiple days of dosing to achieve steady state, as well as potential optimisation of side-effect profiles.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Abnormal prefrontal functioning plays a central role in the working memory (WM) deficits of schizophrenic patients, but the nature of the relationship between WM and prefrontal activation remains undetermined. Using two functional neuroimaging methods, we investigated the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting in schizophrenic and healthy participants. We focused on the brain activation during WM maintenance phase with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also examined oxygenated hemoglobin changes in relation to memory performance with the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using the same spatial WM task. Distinct types of correct and error trials were segregated for analysis. fMRI data indicated that prefrontal activation was increased during WM maintenance on correct trials in both schizophrenic and healthy subjects. However, a significant difference was observed in the functional asymmetry of frontal activation pattern. Healthy subjects showed increased activation in the right frontal, temporal and cingulate regions. Schizophrenic patients showed greater activation compared with control subjects in left frontal, temporal and parietal regions as well as in right frontal regions. We also observed increased ‘false memory’ errors in schizophrenic patients, associated with increased prefrontal activation and resembling the activation pattern observed on the correct trials. NIRS data replicated the fMRI results. Thus, increased frontal activity was correlated with the accuracy of WM in both healthy control and schizophrenic participants. The major difference between the two groups concerned functional asymmetry; healthy subjects recruited right frontal regions during spatial WM maintenance whereas schizophrenic subjects recruited a wider network in both hemispheres to achieve the same level of memory performance. Increased “false memory” errors and accompanying bilateral prefrontal activation in schizophrenia suggest that the etiology of memory errors must be considered when comparing group performances. Finally, the concordance of fMRI and NIRS data supports NIRS as an alternative functional neuroimaging method for psychiatric research.

## Introduction 
  
Working memory is a limited-capacity, active short-term memory system that guides and controls behavior in context. The working memory deficit in schizophrenia, first reported in the early 90s   has become an important cornerstone in understanding the pathophysiology of this disorder. Our earlier studies as well as a new meta-analysis   indicate that stable and reliable working memory deficits are observed in schizophrenic patients across diverse paradigms, methods and techniques. In addition, individuals at risk for schizophrenia, such as healthy, unmedicated first-degree relatives of schizophrenic subjects  –  and psychometrically-ascertained schizotypal subjects also show working memory deficits  – . In schizophrenic subjects, working memory deficit is permanent and stable even when their clinical symptoms are largely in remission  ,  . The persistent and trait-like nature of working memory deficit in schizophrenic patients and in healthy first-degree relatives suggests that it may be an endophenotypic marker for schizophrenia  ,  ,  , and hence a potential aid to discovering the genetic basis of this disorder. Moreover, working memory deficit may be central to cognitive deficits  , which predict functional outcome better than do clinical symptoms  –  and it is associated with poor social functioning in schizophrenia  ,  . Not surprisingly, working memory deficits have become a major therapeutic target for pharmacological and behavioral treatment strategies. Thus, it is important to specify the origins and consequences of the deficit but we do not know yet know much about the reasons for the deficit. 

Much is known about the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in working memory and its regulation of higher cognitive functions in non-human primates  ,  . In nonhuman primates, working memory has been studied extensively with the delayed-response task since 1930s  . A prototypical delayed-response task involves presentation of a stimulus, followed by a short delay and the subsequent presentation of response choices. The ability to perform a delayed-response task is compromised by lesions in the DLPFC  ,  . The principal sulcus (PS, Area 46) is thought to mediate spatial working memory, because neurons in the principal sulcus are involved in maintenance of spatial information over time  – . For example, when a saccadic eye movement to a target is delayed, the neurons in the principal sulcus increase and maintain firing during the delay period, but as soon as the response is made, the firing rate decreases rapidly to the baseline level. These neurophysiological data also indicate that a robust increase in the prefrontal neuronal activity during the delay period is correlated with the accuracy of working memory  – . 

In healthy humans, better working memory performance is correlated with increased prefrontal activation  – . In contrast, the relationship between working memory accuracy and prefrontal activation in schizophrenic patients is not yet clearly understood. Many neuroimaging studies of working memory have demonstrated   task-related hypofrontality   in schizophrenic patients  – . However, there are also studies showing evidence of increased activation in the prefrontal cortex (‘hyperfrontality’) in schizophrenia patients  ,  . Thus a simple hypofrontality hypothesis cannot account for working memory deficits in schizophrenia. To date, hypofrontality, hyperfrontality, reduced asymmetry, “inefficiency” and other factors have been proposed to account for working memory deficits  – , but how these factors influence the degree or the direction of prefrontal activations with respect to working memory performance is poorly understood. These results suggest that the task demands and performance must be considered in evaluating the cortical activation patterns of in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. We also need to better understand what “activation” means in neuroimaging studies. Activating a system or network may not necessarily correlate with the behavioral performance. Inactivation may be the result of many factors. One reason may be a failure to engage the network that is needed to perform a certain function; the hypofrontality hypothesis of schizophrenia assumes this. However, neural activation may also reflect the degree of expertise. The neural network(s) involved in a task when a subject is a novice shifts to a different engagement of other networks as the subject becomes more skilled  . Thus, inactivity of a network may signify automaticity and expertise rather than failure. Inactivation of a certain region might also mean that a different system is engaged to perform the same task (different strategy) or that even if the same brain regions are activated for a particular task, they may come “on-line” at different times  . Thus, we need to better understand what activation patterns signify in functional neuroimaging studies when different diagnostic groups (who may use different strategies) are being compared. 

The present study planned to investigate whether working memory performance in schizophrenia is tightly coupled with prefrontal activation, as it is generally observed in healthy individuals  ,  . Previous functional neuroimaging studies of working memory comparing schizophrenia patients and healthy controls do not provide adequate information concerning the degree of association between working memory performance and prefrontal cortical activation in schizophrenia patients because the control and patient groups were not matched for performance accuracy  ,  ,  . Other studies controlled for this difference in performance by matching overall working memory accuracy between the two groups and still found reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activation in schizophrenia patients  ,  . However, matching overall accuracy alone may not be sufficient if different types of memory errors are elicited via different mechanisms in schizophrenia patients. We have argued elsewhere  ,  ,   that there are distinct processes that lead to working memory errors (e.g., problems in encoding, maintenance or inhibition). For example, working memory errors may arise from a failure to encode the target or from losing internal representations during maintenance; such error trials should correlate with reduced or absent prefrontal activation because active maintenance did not occur. In contrast, a very different type of errors will be elicited if participants encode a non-target object or location (i.e., incorrect stimulus) and maintain this representation successfully during the delay. This is akin to a “false memory” because the incorrect stimulus has been encoded and maintained, producing incorrect behavioral response. However, since its internal representation was maintained during the delay, this type of error should result in increased prefrontal activation. On such false memory trials, subjects maintain an internal representation, albeit a wrong one, and they are also likely to be confident of their responses they make based on this representation maintained in working memory. Therefore, to understand the relationship between working memory performance and cortical activation patterns, finer analyses of behavioral performance and error types in schizophrenia patients are needed and it is critical to differentiate distinct error types as well as examining correct and error trials separately. However, different types of errors have not been distinguished in functional neuroimaging studies of working memory. 

The main goal of this study was to elucidate the neural correlates of working memory in schizophrenia by focusing on cortical activation during correct and error trials with two functional imaging experiments. In Experiment 1, we compared cortical activation in schizophrenia patients and normal controls on a spatial delayed response task (see  ) using fMRI, focusing on correct vs. error trials. In a spatial delayed response task, participants were asked to remember locations of targets after a delay period of 12 seconds, which allowed us to separate correct vs. error trials based on the accuracy of their performance. To differentiate different types of errors, we asked participants to rate the confidence of their response. Correct and error responses were further divided according to the confidence ratings. Errors with very high confidence ratings suggest that subjects were certain of remembering   something   albeit an inappropriate one (e.g., false memory errors). On the other hand, errors with very low confidence ratings would indicate that these were true memory errors. 
   A schematic diagram of the spatial working memory (WM) task.  
After the presentation of a fixation point (1000 ms), three targets appeared one after the other for 750 ms each with an interstimulus interval of 250 ms. A delay period of 12 s followed. Then a probe was presented. Participants were asked to decide whether the probe was located in one of the target locations or not. After they made a response, they were asked to rate their confidence level for the response that they had just made. 
  
The second goal of this study was to test the less invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a viable alternative to fMRI using the same task employed in Experiment 1. fMRI has become the standard brain imaging method to examine the neural correlates of cognitive function, but the MRI environment can lead to difficulties in recruiting psychiatric patients because of stringent exclusion criteria. Moreover, many patients exceed the safety weight limit of the scanner, in part due to atypical antipsychotic medication  . Thus, it is possible that patients who participate in fMRI studies may be a biased sample of schizophrenia patients due to stringent exclusion criteria. Paranoia, anxiety or claustrophobia can also prevent patients from participating. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop an alternative imaging strategy. 

Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a relatively new, non-invasive method that allows us to investigate functional brain activation patterns  – . When light was found to be a sensitive tool for measuring the hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation in the blood  , imaging of reflected light began to be widely used in studies of animals to examine the functional architecture of the cortex. NIRS uses the near infrared spectrum (700–1000 nm wavelength) to monitor changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin   in vivo  . Light from the near infrared spectrum can penetrate the skull and is absorbed mainly by oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin which have different absorption spectra. Changes in the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in the brain tissue can be calculated from the amount of absorbed near infrared light using the modified Lambert-Beer Law, as mutually exclusive windows of near infrared wavelengths are sensitive to oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin substrates  . Thus, NIRS measures cortical activation based on oxygenation of hemoglobin, similar to the fMRI BOLD response. Furthermore, NIRS provides reasonable spatial resolution and has advantages over fMRI including good temporal resolution, better motion tolerance, no noise, and increased comfort for the participants. Obesity and metal implant(s) are not impediments. These characteristics of NIRS suggest its role as a suitable alternative method of fMRI in psychiatric research. However, before NIRS can be used widely in psychiatric research, it should be validated against fMRI and other imaging methods. In Experiment 2, we used NIRS to examine the neural correlates of working memory in schizophrenia, using the same task as in Experiment 1. 

To summarize, we used two functional neuroimaging methods to examine spatial working memory function in schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects. We used a spatial delayed response task, which has been studied extensively in neurophysiological studies of working memory in nonhuman primates and thus provides a close animal analogue. With an event-related design, we aimed to observe cortical activation during correct vs. error trials in order to understand the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting. In addition, we examined qualitatively distinct types of error trials to further specify the behavioral and neural difference between errors that arise from a loss of mental representation versus those which arise from encoding an incorrect stimulus. 


## Results 
  
### Experiment 1: An event-related fMRI study of spatial working memory maintenance in schizophrenic and healthy control participants 
  
Behavioral data show that healthy controls were more accurate than schizophrenia patients (mean = 86±9% and 75±9%, respectively, t  = 2.39, p<0.05) on the spatial working memory task overall. To examine different types of errors in relation to brain activation, we divided total responses into two categories based on the confidence ratings; ‘confident’ for the ratings 1 and 2 and ‘not-confident’ for the ratings 4 and 5. We then examined the accuracy of ‘confident’ responses. 84% of healthy controls' total responses were rated as confident and among these, 92% were correct. Schizophrenia patients rated 86% of their total responses as confident, but only 77% of these were correct, producing more incorrect but confident responses compared with controls (χ  = 17.41, p<0.001). This result suggests that schizophrenia patients may have encoded and maintained ‘wrong’ representations in working memory and as a result, produced incorrect but confident responses (i.e. “false memory” response). 

The delay-related (maintenance phase) BOLD activity of schizophrenia patients was compared with that of healthy controls on correct trials. Since we selected only the correct trials for this comparison, the behavioral performance is matched across the two groups.   displays the brain regions activated during spatial working memory maintenance in both groups. During the delay period, healthy control subjects showed increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) ( ). In addition, controls showed greater activation in the right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared with schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia patients recruited a wider network at the same level of performance. One significant importance is that they activated several left hemisphere regions during spatial working memory maintenance. The patients showed a greater activation compared with the controls in the left MFG, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the left CG as well as the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the left STG. In the right hemisphere, they showed increased activation in the anterior part of the right CG, the right insular, the right MFG and the right SFG. With respect to the right frontal activation in schizophrenic patients, the increased activity seems to occur later than in control subjects.

To test whether schizophrenia patients indeed maintained mental representations during “false” memory trials, the delay-related BOLD activity for error trials with high confidence ratings was examined in schizophrenia patients ( ). Similar analyses for healthy controls could not be performed due to the small number of such false memory trials. On false memory trials, schizophrenia patients activated left MFG, SFG, CG, and IFG and the right MFG; similar to the areas recruited during the correct working memory trials in schizophrenia patients. It is likely that schizophrenia patients maintained the internal representation of incorrect stimuli during these trials, resulting in active recruitment of a working memory network. 

The right MFG was activated for both groups during the spatial working memory maintenance phase, but schizophrenia patients activated additional left hemisphere regions (left MFG and IFG). Clearly lateralized activation in the right PFC during spatial working memory was only observed in healthy controls. In addition, schizophrenia patients activated the same bilateral network on correct and false memory trials, suggesting that they maintained the representation of ‘wrong’ targets during those trials. This finding illustrates the utility of more fine-grained analysis of errors in specifying the potential causal factors leading to working memory deficits. 

There are caveats. Age and education were not matched across groups. To address this issue, we compared a subset of controls (n = 5) who were age- and education- matched to schizophrenia patients and observed the identical pattern of results. Secondly, the sample size was small. These two problems are common in fMRI studies of psychiatric patients because many patients are unwilling to or unable to participate in a MRI experiment. Therefore, there is a need to develop and test an alternative imaging method that allows participation by a larger number of patients. We conducted an identical spatial working memory experiment using NIRS. 


### Experiment 2: An event-related near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study of spatial working memory maintenance 
  
Accuracy on the spatial delayed response task was compared between the two groups. Behavioral data showed a trend towards a group difference (accuracy; controls, 88±7%, schizophrenia patients, 80± 2%, t  = 1.83, p = 0.08). We divided the responses according to the confidence ratings, as described above in the fMRI results section. Healthy controls rated 81% of their total responses as confident and of those, 91% were correct. Schizophrenic patients rated 74% of the total responses as confident, and 81% of these confident responses were correct. Patients produced more incorrect but confident responses compared with healthy controls (χ  = 14.2, p<0.001), suggesting that they were prone to ‘false memory’ errors. These behavioral data replicate those observed in the fMRI experiment described in the previous section. 

To examine whether schizophrenia patients showed a differential activation pattern during spatial working memory maintenance, delay-related changes in NIRS data of patients were compared with that of controls on correct trials. Oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), and total hemoglobin (total-Hb) data were compared separately.   presents time course graphs of peak activation for the oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb and total-Hb in the frontal cortex. Healthy controls showed greater deoxy-Hb concentration in the right frontal cortex whereas schizophrenic patients showed greater deoxy-Hb concentration in the left frontal cortex. Schizophrenic patients showed greater activation in the bilateral frontal cortex as indicated by both oxy-Hb and total-Hb concentrations, but this pattern was more prominent in the left PFC.

(B) Oxy-Hb data: schizophrenic patients showed greater activation in the bilateral frontal cortex on correct trials. (C) Total-Hb data: schizophrenic patients showed greater activation in the bilateral frontal cortex compared with the control subjects on correct trials. 
  
Schizophrenic patients produced a significant number of confident but incorrect responses (‘false memory’ errors) during the spatial working memory task. The delay-related NIRS data for false memory errors was examined. A similar analysis in healthy controls could not be performed due to the minute number of false memory errors. Schizophrenic patients showed decreased oxy-Hb during the false memory trials in both hemispheres. For deoxy-Hb data, increased deoxy-Hb in the left frontal cortex and decreased deoxy-Hb in the superior part of the right frontal cortex were observed. Schizophrenic patients showed increased total-Hb in both hemispheres during the false memory trials indicating an increased activity of the frontal regions that accompany memory maintenance. Thus, it seems likely that incorrect target representation was maintained during the delay period on such trials. 



## Discussion 
  
We investigated the neural correlates of spatial working memory maintenance in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls using two functional neuroimaging methods: fMRI and NIRS. By using an event-related design and analyzing distinct types of correct and error trials, we aimed to elucidate the role of prefrontal activity in remembering and forgetting. We found that prefrontal activation was increased in both healthy controls and schizophrenic patients on correct memory trials but that the expected hemispheric specialization was greatly reduced in schizophrenic patients. While healthy subjects showed an increased activation of right hemisphere systems during the spatial working memory task, schizophrenic patients tended to show more bilateral or left hemisphere activity. This pattern cannot be due to differences in performance since only correct trials were included in this analysis. Thus, even when behavioral performance is matched, neural activation pattern shows a significant difference between schizophrenic and healthy subjects. In addition, by analyzing different types of errors, we observed that schizophrenia patients, but not healthy control subjects, made false memory errors where they were confident of their memory in spite of incorrect performance. On such error trials, schizophrenic patients showed increased prefrontal activation identical to that shown when they remembered correct locations. 

### Prefrontal cortex and spatial working memory maintenance in schizophrenia 
  
In this study, healthy controls showed the expected lateralized pattern   of activation of the right hemisphere networks during the spatial working memory task. However, this pattern was not observed in schizophrenia patients. The bilateral prefrontal activation of schizophrenia patients on correct trials suggests that a ‘simple’ model of hypofrontality or hyperfrontality cannot account for their working memory deficits. A recent meta-analysis indicates that there is a complex pattern of hyper- and hypo-activation in the regions associated with working memory in schizophrenia  . Walter et al.   also reported an absence of hemispheric asymmetry during verbal and spatial working memory but they did not observe hypo- or hyper-frontality. Since we compared only the correct trials of both groups, our finding is not an artifact of differential performance. Rather, different regions and a more diffuse network seem to be engaged during spatial working memory maintenance in schizophrenia. 

Our results suggest that the cortical activation pattern in schizophrenia patients differs from that of controls, even when the resulting observed behaviors are indistinguishable from those of controls. More symmetrical pattern of activation during spatial working memory in schizophrenia may be the result of a compensatory mechanism for a dysfunctional right hemisphere (RH) in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients do   not   show a RH advantage for processing visuospatial information as controls do  ,  – . RH dysfunction in schizophrenia may be due to reduced or absent brain asymmetry  –  and/or abnormal hemispheric interaction  . Reduced hemispheric asymmetry in schizophrenia may result in a diffuse activation pattern during a specific task, in contrast to a more selective activation of specialized network in controls. It has also been suggested that schizophrenia patients have abnormal cortico-cortical connectivity which may result in anomalous hemispheric specialization of functions  – . 

Another possibility is that the bilateral activation observed may reflect compensatory or increased cognitive effort exerted by schizophrenia patients to achieve correct performance. Schizophrenic patients may have reduced working memory capacity compared with controls  ,  , which means they may find the same task more difficult than do controls, and increasing task difficulty has been shown to result in bilateral activation pattern during a working memory task in healthy individuals  ,  . Thus, schizophrenia patients may increase effort to compensate for reduced working memory capacity to reach the same performance level as controls, resulting in a less lateralized prefrontal activation pattern. 

Our results also showed that the same brain regions were activated for “false” memory trials where errors were coupled with a high degree of confidence. On these trials, schizophrenia patients were very certain that they remembered the targets even though they were incorrect. This finding suggests that schizophrenia patients may have encoded ‘wrong’ targets and maintained the representations with corresponding frontal cortical activation on these false memory trials. Therefore, if patients make a large number of such errors, they may show normal or even hyperfrontal activation during a working memory task in spite of high error rates. The finding of robust activation during false memory trials may partly account for the inconsistent findings of previous studies that have reported hyper and hypofrontality. 


### Using NIRS for psychiatric research 
  
During the spatial working memory task, healthy controls showed greater activation in the right frontal cortex compared with schizophrenia patients, whereas schizophrenia patients showed greater activation in the left frontal cortex in deoxy-Hb. In the oxy-Hb and total-Hb, schizophrenic patients showed hyperactivation compared with controls in bilateral frontal cortex. These suggest that in healthy controls, right frontal cortex clearly supports spatial working memory; but in schizophrenia patients there is additional activation of the left frontal regions, even when the two groups are matched for behavioral performance. 

Our NIRS results diverge slightly from previous studies of schizophrenia using NIRS. We observed increased activation of PFC from oxy-Hb and total-Hb in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, we observed that the deoxy-Hb data were similar to fMRI data. Previous NIRS studies of schizophrenia have shown hypoactivation in the prefrontal cortex especially in oxy-Hb, accompanied with poorer behavioral performance; but the degree of hypoactivation has varied depending on the specific task even within the same study  – . For instance, Shiba et al.   observed smaller oxy-Hb increases in schizophrenic patients during a random-number generation task compared with controls, but not in a sequential learning task. It is possible that functional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex may be task-dependent in schizophrenic patients. In addition, we separated correct from incorrect trials to relate brain activation to performance. Therefore, the brain-behavior relationship we tracked in our study is more specific than has been observed in previous studies. 

We reported all 3 NIRS measurements, each showing some evidence of frontal cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia. Some researchers have argued that among the three Hb measures, deoxy-Hb may be the most accurate indicator of cortical activation because increased oxy-Hb may indicate a change in blood pressure or an increase in skin blood volume  . Deoxy-Hb has also been shown to be associated with the BOLD contrast of fMRI  ,  . However, other studies suggest that oxy-Hb may be better than deoxy-Hb for estimating cortical activation  . Some studies have reported that oxy-Hb level is more closely related to the BOLD signal of fMRI than deoxy-Hb  . Moreover, some report that there are changes in oxy-Hb during cognitive tasks, but not in deoxy-Hb  ,  , although this could be due to the fact that oxy-Hb signals are much larger and therefore easier to detect  ,  . Thus, there is still disagreement as to which parameters may best reflect cortical function in humans. A practical solution would be to report all three measures. 

Overall, the results from the NIRS experiment are in agreement with those obtained from the fMRI experiment in our study and suggest that NIRS is a viable, alternative method. 


### Summary 
  
The findings of this study suggest that even with a very simple paradigm such as the delayed-response task, one must carefully consider the components of working memory in relation to brain activation patterns if we are to understand potential individual differences. Most functional imaging studies of working memory do not distinguish among different types of errors. However, our results suggest that such analyses provide novel insight into the etiology of working memory deficits in schizophrenia. 

We used two imaging techniques in this study. We found that NIRS and fMRI yield comparable data and therefore NIRS could be used as a viable alternative method for situations that are incompatible with MRI. For psychiatric neuroimaging, NIRS could allow increased patient participation. 

There are, however, caveats. The sample size in our fMRI experiment was small. This is offset by the NIRS experiment with a larger sample, but it would be important to replicate these results in a future study. All patients were taking atypical antipsychotic drugs. Therefore we cannot rule out medication effects, but it has been shown that first episode schizophrenia patients  , unmedicated schizophrenia patients   and unmedicated, healthy first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients  ,   show spatial working memory deficits. While a recent study suggests that risperidone may worsen working memory in first episode patients, the same study also reported that the working memory deficit is already present before medication is administered  . Although it seems unlikely that the current findings stem from medication effects, a future study should address it systematically. Lastly, it is important to note that the event-related design and data analyses that segregated correct from error trials allowed us observe the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting, regardless of the overall performance. On correct working memory trials, schizophrenia patients were remembering correctly even if their overall error rates were greater than that of controls. 

To summarize, we observed a reduced functional asymmetry of prefrontal cortex during a spatial working memory task in schizophrenia patients even when the behavioral performance was matched to that of controls who showed a clear right prefrontal activation pattern during the same working memory task. We also found an increased rate of false memory errors in schizophrenia patients, suggesting problems in encoding. 



## Materials and Methods 
  
### Experiment 1: An event-related fMRI study of spatial working memory maintenance in schizophrenic and healthy control participants 
  
#### Participants 
  
Eight schizophrenic outpatients were recruited from the Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital. They met the DSM-IV   criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder based on clinical interviews and chart reviews. Exclusion criteria for schizophrenic subjects included past or current substance abuse, brain injury, neurological disease and medical illnesses known to affect brain function. Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)  . All patients were taking atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, risperidone, or olanzapine). Seven healthy control participants were recruited through advertisements. Exclusion criteria for control subjects were past or present DSM-IV Axis I or II disorder, a family history of psychotic illness in their first- or second-degree relatives, neurological disorder and any illness known to affect brain function. All participants were right-handed. The demographic information is presented in  . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after they were given a complete description of the study. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the protocol and consent procedure. All participants were paid. 
   Demographic information of participants      

#### Spatial working memory (WM) Task 
  
To examine maintenance-related brain activation, participants performed the spatial delayed response task (spatial DRT,  ) adopted from Leung et al.  . Each trial began with presenting a fixation point for 1s. Then 3 targets (identical black circles) were flashed sequentially on a gray background, each in a different location (750 ms each) with the inter-stimulus interval of 250 ms. After a 12s delay, a probe was presented for 3s. Participants were asked to decide whether the probe was at one of the three target locations by pressing their right thumb (YES) or right index finger (NO). Immediately after the decision, participants indicated the confidence level for their response on a 5-point rating scale that ranged from 1 (most confident) to 5 (least confident) by pressing a button corresponding to the 5 digits; “1” corresponded to the right thumb, “2” to the right index finger and so on. An inter-trial interval (ITI) of 8.25s followed the confidence rating before a new trial began. There were seven runs containing 14 trials per run. Participants made their responses (the remembered location of the target and the confidence level of their response) using their dominant hand (i.e., right hand). 


#### Image acquisition 
  
All brain images were collected on a 3 Tesla whole-body GE Signa MRI system with a birdcage head coil at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 19 T1-weighted anatomical images parallel to the anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC) were acquired, along with T2*-weighted functional images parallel to the AC-PC line for BOLD-based images (gradient echo planar imaging sequence, TR = 2000ms, TE = 35ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix = 64×64, slice thickness = 5mm, slice gap = 1mm, FOV = 24×24cm). High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical volumes were also acquired with a magnetization-prepared 3D SPGR imaging sequence. Stimuli were presented through MR-compatible LCD goggles (VisualStim XGA Resonance Technology). 


#### fMRI data analysis 
  
Imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using BrainVoyager 4.9 and QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Holland). Anatomical volumes were transformed into a common stereotactic space  . Functional volumes for each subject were aligned to the transformed anatomical volumes, thereby transforming the functional data into a common brain space across participants. Data pre-processing for functional volumes included image realignment, three-dimensional motion correction, linear de-trending, temporal frequency filtering with high pass filter, and spatial smoothing with a 4-mm Gaussian kernel (full width at half-maximum). The statistical analysis was based on the application of the multi-study general linear model (GLM) to time-series of task-related function volumes. The GLM allows the correlation of predictor variables with the recorded activation data (criterion variables) across scanning sessions on grouped datasets. The GLM in BrainVoyager with predictors of interest (i.e., correct vs. error trials determined from the behavioral data) was applied for the individual Z-normalized volume time courses to investigate the delay-related brain activity. The overall model of fit was assessed by an F-statistic. Significant differences among the conditions (e.g., correct vs. error) were assessed with contrast (  t  ) maps. Obtained   p   values were corrected for multiple comparisons with False Discovery Rate (FDR) of .05. The FDR controls the expected proportion of false positives among suprathreshold voxels, instead of controlling for the change in any false positives as Bonferroni correction method does  ,  . 



### Experiment 2: An event-related Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) study of spatial working memory maintenance 
  
#### Participants 
  
Thirteen right-handed schizophrenic subjects (8 of them had participated in the fMRI experiment) and 11 matched healthy controls participated in the study. Recruitment of participants, and exclusion/inclusion criteria for the patients and healthy controls were identical as those in Experiment 1 (see   for demographic information). All patients were taking atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine). All participants were provided a complete description of the study and gave written informed consent. The Vanderbilt University IRB approved the study protocol and consent procedure and all participants were compensated. 


#### Spatial WM Task 
  
The same spatial WM task used in Experiment 1 was administered. 


#### NIRS Measurement 
  
NIRS was performed using a 24-channel (maximum) 780–830 nm spectrometer (ETG-100 system; Hitachi Medical Corp.), composed of emitter-detector pairs. Each emitter was composed of two continuous laser diodes (3mW± 0.15 mW on ‘high’ power) with different wavelengths (780±20 and 830±20 nm) that were amplitude modulated (0.6 and 1.5 Khz). The distance between the pair of emitter and detector probe was 30 mm, which produced a light penetration close to 20 mm. Signals were acquired at a sample rate of 10 Hz from 22 cortical regions on the bilateral prefrontal cortex using the 3×5 probe holder and the corresponding optodes. The signal was amplified, demodulated, and then digitized. 


#### Anatomical Localization 
  
Probes were placed on the forehead according to the international 10–20 system of electrode placement used for EEG and ERP. The middle vertical band of optodes was placed along the z (midline) axis extending from the Fp position ventrally (just superior and horizontal to the Obicularis oculi muscles) towards a caudal position proximal to the Fz position along the Frontalis muscles. However, unlike EEG electrode placement that uses relative (10–20% distance from nasion and inion) place of electrodes in individual skulls, the NIRS optodes were placed in a fixed holder that cannot be stretched or compressed for individual variation in skull measurements. Therefore, some anatomical variation inevitably exists among individuals. However, this method assures a high level of standardization across participants with the right hemisphere probes covering areas Fp2, F4 and F8 and the left hemisphere probes covering area Fp1, F5 and F7. 


#### NIRS data analysis 
  
NIRS data were analyzed using Matlab (The Mathworks) and Brain Voyager-QX. First, a temporal filter was applied to remove any artifact due to respiration and cardiac variation using a bandpass filter with a range 0.01–0.5 Hz. After temporal downsampling (from 10–1 Hz.), NIRS data were converted to the measurement of oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), and total hemoglobin (total-Hb) levels according to the modified Beer-Lambert Law  . These data were converted into a format compatible with Brain Voyager QX using an in-house program after an addition of a constant (500) to each measurement (required to make NIRS data compatible with raw signal data colleted in magnetic resonance research). This allowed us to analyze NIRS data in exactly the same way as in Experiment 1. Data pre-processing included linear de-trending to remove overall linear drifts. The GLM was used to compare whether schizophrenic subjects showed a different pattern of brain activation compared to healthy control subjects, focusing on the delay period of the spatial working task. Thus, the significance of predictors of interest was studied using an F-test followed by paired comparisons. The FDR of .05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Evidence suggests functional brain networks, especially the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN), to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Dysfunctions within the locus coeruleus (LC)‐noradrenaline (NE) system, which is supposed to be pivotal to modulate neuronal network activation during executive control (e.g., working memory function), are also considered to play a vital role in the occurrence of positive (e.g., hallucinatory) or negative (e.g., inattentive) symptoms in these patients. In the present study, we sought to shed further light on the role of the LC‐NE system in patients with schizophrenia. More specifically, we wanted to improve our understanding of the relationship and possible disturbances of the ECN and DMN during a working memory task in patients. A total of 58 healthy control subjects and 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia were investigated using a working memory 3‐back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Main findings of our present study were differential dynamics of ECN and DMN blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activations with increasing task demands in both patients and controls. Moreover, we found increased BOLD activation in the LC in patients compared to controls in the interaction contrast between groups and conditions. LC BOLD activation significantly correlated with both, the main hub of the ECN, that is, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and of the DMN, that is, the posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, the LC‐NE system seems to be crucial in modulating neuronal network activity in a 3‐back working memory task and might significantly contribute to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
 Working memory   (WM) is a crucial cognitive competence when multiple goals are pursued. In addition, it is important to guide behavior on the basis of information that is not available in the direct environment (Braver & Ruge,  ; D'Esposito & Postle,  ). As an important part of higher cognitive functions, working memory enables us to temporarily hold and manipulate information with limited capacity (Baddeley,  ). The n‐back task is a popular working memory task which asks subjects to monitor a series of, for instance, verbal stimuli and to indicate when the currently presented stimulus is the same as the one presented n trials previously. Thus, online monitoring, updating, and manipulation of information are required (Owen et al.,  ). 

Functional MRI studies consistently report a cortico‐striatal network subserving WM processes. This   executive control network   (ECN) encompasses core hubs such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), parietal cortex, and striatum (Murty et al.,  ; Tan et al.,  ). Working memory impairments and ECN dysfunction are consistently reported in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia or attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (Jiang et al.,  ; Kofler et al.,  ). For instance, Jiang et al., ( ) investigated how neuronal activation is altered in schizophrenia using a n‐back working memory task that has included a 0‐back and a 2‐back condition. They found patients compared to healthy controls showing an exaggerated response in the right DLPFC (Brodmann area (BA) 46) and bilateral VLPFC, as well as reduced activation in the bilateral DLPFC (BA 9). Jansma et al., ( ) used a parametric fMRI design and a spatial 3‐back working memory task to examine relations between working memory load, performance, and brain activity in patients with schizophrenia taking second‐generation antipsychotics compared to healthy controls. Despite the increasingly poor performance in patients, activity increased normally in DLPFC and inferior parietal cortex bilaterally as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with increasing working memory load. At the 3‐back condition, activity dropped in the DLPFC in comparison with controls, but not in the other regions. The results indicate that peak activation of the WM system is reached at a lower processing load in patients than in healthy controls. As a decline of DLPFC activity at high processing loads in itself is not abnormal, WM dysfunction in schizophrenia was suggested to be the result of an impaired functional output of the whole WM system. 

Prior work has especially focused on the role of the ECN in working memory, but recent research suggests that the ECN is just one of several interacting networks being critical for task engagement (Kamp et al.,  ; McCormick & Telzer,  ; Vatansever et al.,  ). Specifically, the   default mode network   (DMN) has gained attention in this respect. The DMN refers to a resting‐state network that is thought to show greater activity at rest. More specifically, the DMN tends to be active when one is engaging in internally driven cognitive processes such as self‐generated thoughts, mind‐wandering, or autobiographical memory retrieval (Andrews‐Hanna et al.,  ; Raichle et al.,  ). Core hubs of the DMN are the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the adjacent precuneus (Prec), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mesial and inferior temporal lobes (mTL/iTL), and inferior parietal lobe (iPL) (Bär et al.,  ; Raichle et al.,  ). In most cognitive control tasks, where attention is directed externally, the ECN shows increases and the DMN decreases in neuronal activation. Unsworth and Robison ( ) summarized that during attention control tasks, also including working memory tasks, lapses of attention and mind‐wandering are related to a reduced ECN and increased DMN BOLD activation. In consequence, goal‐directed behavior often worsens. Thus, in many cognitive control tasks where attention has to be allocated to external stimuli interactions between the ECN and DMN are critical for success. The ECN is needed to maintain task goals and prevent lapses of attention by suppressing the DMN. 

In patients with schizophrenia, many fMRI studies have demonstrated abnormal activity within the DMN during a broad range of tasks (Hu et al.,  ), also including working memory tasks (Kim et al.,  ; Pomarol‐Clotet et al.,  ). Reduced suppression of the DMN in patients with schizophrenia is often interpreted as a failure to allocate cognitive resources adequately resulting in an impaired task performance. However, whether reduced suppression of the DMN is better interpreted as the cause or the consequence of impaired cognition is still a matter of debate. Interestingly, in a study by Whitfield‐Gabrieli et al., ( ) patients with schizophrenia were found to continue to exhibit reduced DMN suppression, especially in the MPFC, even when statistically controlling for cognitive performance as well as when analyzing an easy task condition in which patients performed comparable to controls. 

One major candidate influencing PFC function in schizophrenia is the norepinephrine (NE) system which arises from the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem. The LC‐NE system widely projects throughout the cortex and is well suited to modulate widely distributed neuronal networks such as those engaged by the PFC during higher‐order cognition. There is plentiful evidence in both animal and human studies that NE strongly modulates PFC function during cognitive processes, that is, working memory (Aston‐Jones & Cohen,  ; Durstewitz & Seamans,  ; Moore et al.,  ; Robbins & Arnsten,  ). In a recent network analysis, we found evidence that the LC is integrated into the ECN (Bär et al.,  ). 

The importance of the LC‐NE system for working memory and attention is also emphasized by psychopharmacological studies. For example, it has been shown that drugs increasing the central NE concentration (e.g., modafinil) lead to more subjective alertness and a better performance on some attention control and working memory measures (Chamberlain & Robbins,  ). Modafinil has also been shown to be related to the deactivation of the DMN during task performance (Minzenberg et al.,  ). Furthermore, pharmacological manipulations typically depend on baseline levels of arousal, suggesting the importance of tonic NE levels in determining the attentional state (Coull et al.,  ; Smith & Nutt,  ). 

While a major prevailing hypothesis is that altered dopaminergic and/or glutamatergic signaling contributes to the development and etiology of schizophrenia, there is also evidence that the LC‐NE system might be involved (Borodovitsyna et al.,  ; Yamamoto & Hornykiewicz,  ). It has been proposed that the development of both positive (delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder) and negative symptoms (affective blunting, inattention, and abulia) of schizophrenia might be related to NE dysregulation. For instance, Yamamoto and Hornykiewicz ( ) concluded that the psychopathology of positive and negative symptoms might be caused from hyper‐ and hypo‐vigilant states of consciousness, respectively. Other imaging studies using positron emissions tomography also proposed hyper‐activation of the temporal cortex and limbic areas, as well as hypo‐activation of prefrontal areas as correlates of positive and negative symptoms, respectively (Andreasen et al.,  ; Silbersweig et al.,  ). Further, NE has been found to be elevated in both the blood plasma (Kemali et al.,  ) and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with schizophrenia, especially those with positive symptoms (Kemali et al.,  ; Lake et al.,  ). Postmortem studies have also reported increased markers for NE in the brains of patients who suffered from schizophrenia (Bird et al.,  ; Farley et al.,  ).

In the present study, we want to shed further light on the role of the LC‐NE system in patients with schizophrenia being a key neurotransmitter system to modulate neuronal network activation. More specifically, we want to improve our understanding of the relationship and possible disturbances of human brain networks during a working memory task in patients.    First   , considering previous findings, we assume a reduced working memory performance in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Our    second    assumption is that core regions of the ECN, especially the DLPFC, show less BOLD activation during working memory performance in SZ patients compared to healthy controls.    Third   , we also hypothesize less deactivation of DMN core nodes such as the PCC in SZ patients compared to HC especially when cognitive demand is highest.    Lastly   , we suppose that LC BOLD activation is positively related to DLPFC and negatively related to PCC BOLD activations in HC, but not in patients. 



## METHODS 
  
### Sample characteristics 
  
A total of 58 healthy control subjects (40 male and 18 female) were recruited by local newspaper advertisement and screened for psychiatric or neurological diseases by a psychiatrist. Subjects with past or current neurological or psychiatric diseases and/or first‐degree relatives with axis I psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. 40 patients (29 male and 11 female) meeting the DSM‐IV criteria for schizophrenia according to the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM‐IV Axis I disorders were recruited and screened by a psychiatrist from the inpatient service of the psychiatric university hospital in Jena. Patients were included in the study during symptom remission and not in an acute state of the disease. Patients with a current comorbid axis I disorder (according to SCID) or with neurological disorders were excluded from this study. 39 patients received second‐generation antipsychotics (see Table  ). The antipsychotic treatment was quantified using chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalents (Andreasen et al.,  ). The mean CPZ equivalent was 652.55 (  SD   = 460.45) mg/day. One patient was medication naïve. Six patients were additionally treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; Sertralin, Escitalopram). The patients' psychopathological status was assessed using the Scales of Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms (SAPS and SANS). Patients' scores were   M   = 23.49 (  SD   = 17.82) on SAPS and   M   = 19.38 (  SD   = 16.82) on SANS. The mean age at onset of schizophrenia was 26.52 years (  SD   = 8.38). On average, patients reported an illness duration of   M   = 7.85 (  SD   = 8.64) years. 

In healthy controls, the mean age was 34.47 (  SD   = 12.56) years. Patients had a mean age of 35.3 (  SD   = 12.7) years. Duration of school education was 11.43 (  SD   = 0.99) years for HC and 10.95 (  SD   = 1.29) years for patients. A two‐sample   t   test showed no significant group differences regarding age (  t  (96)=−0.32, n.s.), no significant difference in education (  t  (64.83)=1.96,   p   =.06), and no significant differences in overall impulsivity (BIS;   t  (54.94)=−1.95,   p   =.06). We found significant group differences in trait (STAI trait;   t  (50.28)=−6.41,   p   <.001) and state anxiety (STAI state;   t  (49.9)=−4.6,   p   <.001) as well as inferential logic (LPS;   t  (68.99)=3.77,   p   <.001). However, in both HC and SZ inferential logic is within the average range. Sample characteristics are summarized in Table  . 
  
Demographic and clinical data of healthy controls and patients 
    
All subjects were German native speakers, right‐handed according to the modified version of Annetts Handedness Inventory (Briggs & Nebes,  ), and provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Jena. All subjects were paid 8 Euro per hour for their participation. 


### Experimental design 
  
We used a parametric n‐back task containing a baseline condition (x‐back) and three different load levels (1‐back, 2‐back, and 3‐back). The working memory 3‐back task was performed during a functional MRI scan and was arranged as a block design with an overall number of five blocks of each condition. Using the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., USA), single white letters (A–Z) were presented in a pseudo‐randomized order and appeared for 1800ms on a black background. All letters were separated by an interstimulus interval (blank screen) lasting 2500ms. During the baseline condition, participants had to react by button press as soon as an “X” appeared on the screen. The 1‐back condition demanded a response to any letter that matched the last letter seen. The 2‐back condition demanded a response to any letter that matched the last but one letter seen. In the 3‐back condition, participants were required to respond to any letter that matched the last but two letters. Each task block started with the presentation of the following task condition and was presented for 4000ms. The instruction was followed by a fixation cross which appeared for another 4000ms before the presentation of the single letters. Task conditions were presented in a pseudo‐randomized order. Letters were presented with a ratio of 85 nontargets to 25 targets in each condition. 

Visual stimuli were projected on to a transparent screen inside the scanner tunnel which could be viewed by the subject through a mirror system mounted on top of the MRI head coil. The subjects’ responses were registered by an MRI‐compatible fiber optic response device (Lightwave Medical Industries, Canada) with one response button on a keypad for the right hand. 


### Assessment scales 
  
To better describe sample characteristics, we collected different scales.   Impulsivity  , as a   personality trait  , was assessed by the Barratt Impulsivity Scale 11 (BIS‐11; Patton et al.,  ). The purpose of the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Laux et al.,  ) is to measure the presence and severity of current symptoms of anxiety as well as a general tendency to be anxious. Inferential logic was assessed using a subtest of the Performance Testing System (LPS; Horn,  ) to get an idea of current cognitive abilities of the participants. The patients' psychopathological status was assessed using the Scales of Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms (SAPS and SANS). 


### Data acquisition 
  
Data were collected on a 3T whole‐body system equipped with a 64‐element receive‐only head matrix coil. T2*‐weighted images were obtained using a gradient‐echo EPI sequence (TR = 2120ms, TE = 36ms, TA = 2100ms, FOV = 224mm , acquisition matrix = 160×160 mm , and flip angle = 90°) with 104 interleaved transverse slices of 1.4 mm thickness, a multi‐band acceleration factor of 4, and with an in‐plane resolution of 1.4 × 1.4 mm . A series of 626 whole‐brain volume sets were acquired in one session lasting approximately 25 min. High‐resolution anatomical T1‐weighted volume scans (MP‐RAGE) were obtained in sagittal orientation (TR = 2300ms, TE = 3.03ms, TI = 900ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV = 256mm×256mm, matrix 256 × 256, number of sagittal slices = 192, and acceleration factor (PAT = 2) with an isotropic resolution of (1 × 1×1) mm ). 


### Physiological recordings during fMRI 
  
During the fMRI scan, respiratory and cardiac signals were recorded simultaneously using an MR‐compatible BIOPAC MP150 polygraph (BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) and digitized at 500 Hz. Respiratory activity was assessed by a strain gauge transducer incorporated in a belt tied around the chest, approximately at the level of the processus xiphoideus. The cardiac signal, photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal, was recorded using a pulse oximeter attached to the proximal phalanx of the index finger of the subject's left hand. 

To remove MRI‐related or movement artifacts, the PPG signal was band‐pass filtered (0.05–3 Hz), and the respiratory signal was low‐pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz. Pulse‐wave onsets were automatically extracted by detecting peaks of the temporal derivative of the filtered PPG signal (Schumann et al.,  ). The quality of peak detection was visually inspected by an expert and corrected when necessary. 


### fMRI preprocessing 
  
Data analysis was performed using SPM12 (  http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ) and AFNI software package (  https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/  ). The first four images were discarded to ensure a steady‐state tissue magnetization condition. Time‐locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts as well as slow blood oxygenation level fluctuations were removed using RETROICOR (Glover et al.,  ) and respiration volumes per time regressors (Birn et al.,  ). RETROICOR and RVT regressors were generated on a slice‐wise basis by AFNI's “RetroTS.m” script (Jo et al.,  ). 

Further preprocessing steps of the fMRI data included slice timing correction, rigid body realignment to the mean of all images, and alignment of functional and anatomical data. Afterward, images were normalized to the MNI space using the DARTEL procedure integrated into SPM12 (Ashburner,  ) and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half‐maximum. 

To accurately identify nuclei within the midbrain and brainstem for the subsequent time‐series extraction, neuroimaging data were normalized to the spatially unbiased infra‐tentorial template (SUIT, version 3.1; Diedrichsen,  ). This procedure was performed after following all previous steps up to coregistration. Using the SUIT toolbox, we applied the following preprocessing steps: (i) segmentation of the whole‐brain image dataset as implemented in SPM12, (ii) cropping of the image dataset, retaining only the cerebellum and brainstem, (iii) normalization using the DARTEL engine (Ashburner,  ), which uses gray‐ and white‐matter segmentation maps produced during cerebellar isolation to generate a flowfield using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM; Miller et al.,  ), and (iv) reslicing to a voxel size of (1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5) mm . 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
Performance was assessed by the number of correct reactions in each condition. Repeated measures ANOVAs with the within‐subject factor task (x‐back, 1‐back, 2‐back, 3‐back) and the between‐subject factor group (patients, controls) were performed. 

Using the SPM12 software, a fixed‐effects model with a block design including both correct and false responses at a single‐subject level was performed to create contrast images of parameter estimates. Importantly, one regressor per condition was also included in modulating performance accuracy and, thus, controlling for performance. For each subject, the baseline condition (x‐back) was subtracted from the activation contrasts (1‐back, 2‐back, 3‐back). Thus, all comparisons were standardized on the control condition (x‐back). Final contrast estimates were then entered into a second‐level analysis. At the second level, a random‐effects full‐factorial design was used to investigate neuronal activation in the groups (i.e., patients and controls) and conditions (1‐back, 2‐back, 3‐back). A one‐way ANOVA with group (patients versus. controls) as the between‐subject factor was performed for each load condition (1‐back, 2‐back, and 3‐back). Post hoc, we also investigated potential associations between neuronal activation in our regions of interest, the dACC, PCC, and LC, by extracting and correlating parameter estimates. To this aim, ROIs were drawn around the voxel with maximum activation including all voxels within a 6mm radius. Beta values were then extracted from all voxels within these ROIs, and the first eigenvariate was calculated via singular value decomposition (SVD) and used for further data processing. If not indicated otherwise, within‐ and between‐group analyses were based on a voxel‐based threshold of 0.001 (uncorrected) and were false discovery rate (FDR) cluster corrected. 


### Behavioral data analysis 
  
Behavioral data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics V22. We conducted a repeated measures ANOVA with the within‐subject factor task (x‐back, 1‐back, 2‐back, and 3‐back) and the between‐subject factor group (healthy controls, HC; patients with schizophrenia, SZ). Post hoc   t   tests were used to test for between‐group differences in performance. To account for the problem of multiple comparisons, we adjusted the statistical significance level using the FDR approach. 


### Brainstem analysis 
  
For the statistical comparison (ANOVA) based on our initial hypotheses, that is, regarding the activation differences in the LC between patients and controls, we used the small volume correction (SVC) method to account for the small size of the brainstem/midbrain nuclei. The LC was a priori anatomically defined as region of interests (ROIs). To obtain the anatomically most precise ROIs, we used the LC mask image in the MNI coordinate space based on Keren et al., ( ), which represents the extent of peak LC signal distribution, obtained from a sample of 44 healthy adults using high‐resolution T1‐weighted Turbo Spin Echo MRI. The statistical significance was set to   p   <.05, FWE voxel‐level corrected. 


### Post hoc subgroup analyses 
  
As we expect that the most demanding condition has a strong influence on neuronal activation and performance, we divided two patient subgroups and performed post hoc subgroup analyses to get an even better understanding of the data at hand. We used the median split‐half method to generate a low‐ and a high‐performing patient group. The critical value calculated, using the performance in the 3‐back condition as reference, was 68% correct trials, and thus, all subjects with equal or below 68% accuracy were identified as low‐performing group and the subjects above 68% accuracy as high‐performing patient group. 

In the patient group, we got   N   = 21 subjects in the low and   N   = 19 subjects in the high‐performing group. Sample characteristics of the patient subgroups are summarized in Table  . To compare schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals more accurately on the neuronal level, we sought to divide the group of healthy individuals based on the performance of patients. However, only four healthy individuals achieved a performance comparable to the low‐performing patient group. Thus, it was not reasonable to divide healthy individuals based on the calculated accuracy cutoff. Consequently, we did not divide healthy subjects into subgroups. Nevertheless, we investigated whether the differences between patients and healthy individuals were caused by performance variations in the patient group. Thus, at first we compared the low‐ and high‐performing patients in the most demanding working memory condition. Accordingly, we then compared low‐ as well as high‐performing patients with the control subject group.

## RESULTS 
  
### Behavioral results and task performance 
  
The repeated measures ANOVA of the number of correct reactions with the within‐subject factor task (x‐back, 1‐back, 2‐back, 3‐back) and the between‐subject factor group (healthy controls, HC; patients with schizophrenia, SZ) revealed a significant main effect of task (  F  (1.917, 183.987)=83.288,   p   <.001; partial η =0.465), a significant main effect of group (  F  (1, 96)=35.098,   p   <.001; partial η =0.268), and a significant interaction between task and group (  F  (1.917, 183.987)=28.45,   p   <.001; partial η =0.229). 

As indicated by post hoc   t   tests, patients performed significantly worse in the 1‐, 2‐, and 3‐back condition compared to healthy controls (1‐back:   t  (42.413)=2.556,   p   = 0.019, 2‐back:   t  (45.116)=4.842,   p  =   0.002, 3‐back:   t  (48.969)=5.738,   p  =   0.002). There was no significant group difference in the control condition (x‐back:   t  (57.417)=1.566,   p   =.123). Figure   pictures performance accuracy in both groups for all task conditions (Figure  ) on the left‐handed side. On the right‐handed side, the percent change of performance accuracy normed on the control condition for healthy controls and patients is pictured (Figure  ).

### Differential neuronal (de‐)activation patterns within and between groups 
  
In general, we found increased BOLD activation patterns during 2‐ and 3‐back in core hubs of the ECN, especially the DLPFC and VLPFC, in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients (Figure   (yellow‐red color); Table  ). Compared to x‐back, we were also able to identify BOLD deactivations in core hubs of the DMN, that is, the PCC and VMPFC, in HC as well as in patients (Figure   (blue‐green color); Table  ).

As hypothesized, we found significantly increased BOLD activations in, for instance, the DLPFC, in the 2‐back condition in HC compared to SZ patients (Figure  ; Table  ). Surprisingly and in contrast to our expectation, we did not find differences in DLPFC activation between groups in the most demanding 3‐back condition. However, in the 3‐back contrast, we identified significantly increased BOLD activation patterns in regions associated with the DMN, especially the PCC, in patients compared to HC (Figure  ; Table  ). This finding, however, met our expectation. There were no significant BOLD activation differences in the easy 1‐back condition between both groups. 


### Neuronal activation patterns with regard to the transition from the 2‐ to 3‐back condition 
  
Overall, we found significant BOLD activation increases from the 2‐ to the 3‐back condition in main regions of the ECN, that is, the DLPFC and VLPFC, in both healthy controls and patients (Figure  , Table  ). The finding in HC accords well with the common view of the literature. However, we did not expect to find this activation pattern in patients. We also identified an increase in BOLD activation in the PCC, as a main hub of the DMN, from the 2‐ to the 3‐back condition in patients only.

   Note    
Further, we identified BOLD activation increases in SZ patients compared to HC in core nodes of the ECN, for example, in the VLPFC, and the DMN, for example, in the PCC, when analyzing changes from the 2‐ to the 3‐back condition (Figure  ; Table  ). The finding of increased PCC activation met our expectation of less deactivation in core regions of the DMN in patients compared to HC with increasing cognitive load. 

In addition, we identified an increased BOLD activation pattern in the left LC (x=−4, y=−39, z=−24, t = 3.08, cluster size = 4,   p   <.001 voxel‐level uncorr.,   p   <.05 FWE voxel‐level corr.) in SZ patients compared to HC in the 3‐back > 2‐back contrast (Figure  ). In regard to this analysis, we used the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT) preprocessed brainstem/cerebellum functional images, and the LC as anatomical mask image (small volume correction, SVC; mask image based on Keren et al.,  ). 


### Correlational analyses 
  
To get further insight in the role of the LC regarding dynamic network modulation, we extracted parameter estimates from the DLPFC (x = 40.5, y = 32, z = 35), as a core hub of the ECN, from the PCC (x=−9, y=−50.5, z = 30.5), as a core hub of the DMN, and from the LC (x=−4, y=−39, z=−24) in the between‐group comparison (SZ 3‐back > 2‐back) > (HC 3‐back > 2‐back). We then correlated the LC BOLD activation with the BOLD activation in the DLPFC as well as with the PCC. Most interestingly, in SZ patients, we found significant positive correlations between both DLPFC (r = 0.56,   p   <.001) and PCC (r = 0.51,   p   <.001) BOLD activations with LC BOLD activation which was not the case in the HC group (Figure  ). These findings confirm our supposition of a relation between LC and DLPFC/PCC BOLD activation which varies between patients and controls.

Abbreviations:   SZ – schizophrenia (orange color), HC – healthy controls (green color), DLPFC – dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, PCC – posterior cingulate cortex, LC – locus coeruleus, r – Pearson correlation coefficient, n.s. – nonsignificant 
  

### Subgroup analyses 
  
An additional aim of our study was to get insight in performance as a critical differentiating factor. Therefore, we compared the low‐ and high‐performing SZ groups in the demanding 3‐back condition. We identified significant BOLD activation patterns in the temporal cortex (TCx), hippocampus (HIPP), and amygdala as well as a medial prefrontal region (Figure  , Table  ). Further, we found increased BOLD activation, for example, in the PCC/precuneus and VMPFC (Figure  , Table  ), in the low‐performing patient sample compared to HC. Comparing BOLD activation changes from the 2‐ to the 3‐back condition between the low‐performing SZ and the HC group, we found increased BOLD activation, for instance, in the left DLPFC, the anterior/posterior insula (a/pIN), HIPP, caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, SMA, PCC/Prec, and TCx (Figure  , Table  ). No significant neuronal activation differences were found by comparing high‐performing patients with control subjects in the most demanding task condition. Thus, the neuronal activation differences between patients and healthy controls seem to be driven by low‐performing patients. 
  
 Subgroup analyses  : A ‐ Patient subgroup analysis in the 3‐back condition was performed on a voxel level of   p   <.005 (uncorr.) and cluster level of   p   <.05 (FDR corr.). B – Low‐performing patients were compared to healthy controls in the hardest task condition. Data were analyzed using a voxel level of   p   <.005 (uncorr.) and a cluster level of   p   <.05 (FDR corr.). C – Low‐performing patients were compared to healthy controls in the 2‐back versus. 3‐back contrast. Data were analyzed using a voxel‐level of   p   <.001 (uncorr.) and a cluster level of   p   <.05 (FDR corr.). D ‐   Brainstem analysis  : Subgroup analysis was performed on a voxel level of   p   <.005 (uncorr.), applying the SVC method using the LC‐mask based on Keren et al.,  ; unmasked brainstem data are depicted.   Abbreviations:   SZ – schizophrenia, HC – healthy controls, HIPP – hippocampus, Caud – Caudate nucleus, TCx – temporal cortex, MCC – mid‐cingulate cortex, PCC – posterior cingulate cortex, Prec – precuneus, VMPFC – ventromedial prefrontal cortex, aIN – anterior insula, SMA – supplementary motor area, Cereb – cerebellum, LC – locus coeruleus, MR ‐ nucleus raphe magnus; R – right hemisphere, L – left hemisphere 
  
Using the SUIT preprocessed brainstem/cerebellum functional images and the LC as anatomical mask images (SVC; Keren et al.,  ), a significantly increased BOLD activation was detected in the 2‐ versus. 3‐back condition in the low‐performing SZ group compared to the HC group in the left LC (x=−4, y=−39, z=−23, t = 2.82, cluster size = 4,   p   <.005 voxel level (uncorr.),   p   <.05 FWE voxel‐level corr.; Figure  ). 


### Subgroup‐specific correlational analyses 
  
We also extracted parameter estimates from the left LC in the between‐group comparison (SZ 3‐back > 2‐back > HC 3‐back > 2‐back) and correlated its BOLD activation with the BOLD signal of both the DLPFC (x = 40.5, y = 32, z = 35) and the PCC (x=−9, y=−50.5, z = 30.5) in the same contrast. Remarkably, in the low‐performing SZ group, we recognized the before found significant positive correlations between both the DLPFC (r = 0.78,   p   <.001) and the PCC (r = 0.76,   p   <.001) with the LC. These relations remained highly significant even after controlling for inferential logic (LC‐DLPFC: r = 0.78,   p   <.001; LC‐PCC: r = 0.75,   p   <.001). However, none of these relations were found in the high‐performing patient group. 



## DISCUSSION 
  
The main findings of our present study were increased BOLD activations in the ECN with increasing task difficulty in both SZ and HC. In controls, increasing cognitive demand also led to decreased BOLD activation in the DMN. However, patients seemed not to be capable to maintain this DMN deactivation over conditions. Interestingly, in the interaction contrast between groups and conditions, we have identified increased BOLD activation in the LC in patients compared to HC. LC BOLD activation significantly correlated with both, the main hub of the ECN, that is, the DLPFC, as well as of the DMN, that is, the PCC. In a subgroup analysis, we discovered that most of the SZ versus. HC group differences were driven by the low‐performing patient group. Most remarkably, in the low‐performing patient group we found the LC being significantly correlated with both the DLPFC and the PCC once again. Thus, the LC seems to play an exquisite role in modulating neuronal activity of the ECN and DMN in a 3‐back working memory task and might contribute to cognitive impairments in SZ. 

Overall, we confirmed our hypothesis with respect to the behavioral results. Patients performed increasingly worse with rising task demands. Nevertheless, it was surprising that patients performed also quite well on both the 2‐ and 3‐back conditions. Further, as indicated by scores on symptom rating scales, patients were not in an acute state of illness which might also contribute to the good performance. 

Our finding of increased ECN BOLD activation, especially in the DLPFC, with increases in working memory load in healthy controls goes along with former research findings (Jansma et al.,  ). In patients with schizophrenia, we also observed increased BOLD activations in core regions of the ECN in regard of the 3‐ versus. 2‐back contrast which was rather surprising. Various research groups are discussing whether PFC hypo‐ or hyper‐activation observed in schizophrenia patients is related to the poor performance on cognitive tasks which is, in general, a feature of this patient group (Jansma et al.,  ; Jiang et al.,  ). Weinberger et al., ( ) proposed that even when patients with schizophrenia are able to keep up with processing demands, they do so less efficiently than controls and need to work harder to keep up which requires the recruitment of greater and/or less focused neuronal activity. Callicott et al., ( ) and Manoach ( ) have further proposed that there is an inverted U‐shaped function between working memory load and PFC activation, such that increasing task demands are first associated with increasing activation, which then falls off after the subject's working memory capacity is exceeded. They argue that this curve is shifted to the left in schizophrenia, causing patients first to show more activation than controls at low task demands, but then to reach their maximum capacity earlier and thereafter show less activation. Another possibility is that increased PFC activation in schizophrenia reflects a failure of DMN deactivation (Greicius et al.,  ; Gusnard et al.,  ; Raichle et al.,  ). 

In our present study, we consistently found core hubs of the DMN, that is, the PCC, being deactivated in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. However, in patients we found BOLD activation increases in the 3‐ versus. 2‐back contrast in core hubs of the DMN. Thus, with increasing task demands patients seemed not to be capable to maintain DMN deactivation over conditions. 

The ECN is needed to maintain task goals and prevent lapses of attention by suppressing the DMN (Unsworth and Robinsn, 2017). Accordingly, former research has suggested that individuals with higher working memory capacities demonstrate a stronger anti‐correlation between ECN and DMN (Keller et al.,  ). Besides, Kelly et al., ( ) and Esterman et al., ( ) have found that greater DMN BOLD activation is associated with greater variability in response times. This finding suggests an association between attentional lapses and DMN activation. In fact, Kelly et al. found that the greater the negative correlation between ECN and DMN, the more consistent behavior was. The weaker the negative correlation between ECN and DMN, the more inconsistent behavior became. 

However, when tasks require retrieval or access of information from memory, the ECN and DMN were also found to act together (Konishi et al.,  ; Smallwood et al.,  ; Spreng et al.,  ; Vatansever et al.,  ). Konishi et al., ( ) used a spatial n‐back task and found, among others, increased BOLD activations in DMN regions. In this context, DMN activation was proposed to be crucial for, for example, task judgments depending on recollections based on memory. Spreng et al., ( ) also demonstrated that the DMN and ECN cooperate to perform a working memory task. 

Considering our results, in schizophrenia patients we found both increases in ECN BOLD activation accompanying increasing task demands and DMN BOLD deactivation. However, patients seemed not to be capable to maintain this DMN deactivation with increasing memory load. Further, we found a strong positive correlation between the DLPFC and PCC which are core hubs of the ECN/DMN, respectively. Most interestingly, we have also found increased BOLD activation in the locus coeruleus in SZ patients compared to HC. 

The LC‐NE system plays a pivotal role in cognitive control (Unsworth & Robison,  ). It is also known that working memory is highly dependent upon noradrenergic neurotransmission in the PFC. For instance, delay‐related firing, an electrophysiological correlate of working memory, occurs in prefrontal neurons in response to a behaviorally relevant stimulus. This type of activation of PFC neurons is potentiated by activation of the   α  2A receptor and diminished by its antagonists. Thus, working memory might be improved or impaired (Wang et al.,  ). Further, the LC was found to be functionally integrated into the ECN in the resting condition (Bär et al.,  ). Regarding our present results, we suppose that the LC directly modulates proper ECN function by indirectly impacting on the DMN during task performance. Thus, an intact LC‐NE system supports working memory function by influencing large‐scale brain networks. One might even suggest that a highly synchronous neuronal activation between both the LC‐NE system and core hubs of the ECN supports cognitive functioning. The network reset theory of Bouret and Sara ( ) suggests that a major function of NE is to reset ongoing brain activity in order to synchronize large‐scale brain networks in preparation for responding. This, together with theories that the P3, which is an event‐related potential being influenced by conflict monitoring and adaptation, is the result of NE release in the cortex suggests that network reset is a potential mechanism leading to coordinated cortical responses following task‐relevant stimuli (Rawls et al.,  ). Subsequently, decreases in task performance, that is, with increasing cognitive demand, might also be driven by a desynchronization of the LC‐NE system and the ECN. In consequence, attentional lapses are probable as well as increases in DMN BOLD activation and a decrease in ECN BOLD activity. What is more, it is assumed that individuals with high attentional control abilities are also characterized by enhanced cognitive control capacities, for example, working memory capacities, than individuals with low attentional control abilities. Thus, during cognitive task performance, desynchronization phenomena might sooner be present in individuals with lower cognitive capacities and reduced attentional control (Unsworth & Robison,  ). This might be the case in individuals suffering from schizophrenia. As a result, on the neuronal level one might still see increased LC and ECN BOLD activation by, however, simultaneously increasing DMN BOLD activation. In this case, depending on task challenges, behavioral performance will also very likely worsen. 

However, when task demands are either too easy or too challenging performance worsens (Aston‐Jones & Cohen,  ; Berridge & Waterhouse,  ; Chamberlain & Robbins,  ; Ramos & Arnsten,  ). Specifically, when tonic LC activity is low (hypo‐arousal), individuals are inattentive, nonalert, and disengaged from the current task leading to poor behavioral performance and little to none phasic LC activity in response to task‐relevant stimuli. As tonic LC activity increases to an intermediate range (phasic response), attention becomes more focused and behavioral performance improves. However, as tonic LC activity increases further, individuals experience a more distractible attentional state (hyper‐arousal and stress) leading to task disengagement, lowered LC phasic activity, and a reduction in behavioral performance. Animal experiments and psychopharmacological studies provide evidence in support of the noted inverted U relationship between the LC‐NE system and behavioral performance (Aston‐Jones & Cohen,  ; Berridge & Waterhouse,  ; Chamberlain & Robbins,  ; Ramos & Arnsten,  ). However, it might be assumed that hypo‐ and hyper‐arousal states of the LC are accompanied by reduced large‐scale brain network synchrony. 

Subgroup analyses of our present study were performed to get further insight into neuronal activation changes, how these are related to LC BOLD activation, and whether performance is a critical differentiating factor which should be accounted for. Indeed, the subgroup analyses were very intriguing. We found the low‐performing SZ group accounting for most of the between‐group differences even though patient groups did not differ in pathology and medication equivalent doses. The high‐performing SZ group exhibited similar neuronal activation patterns such as healthy controls. Even correlational analyses were driven by the low‐performing patient group and, as was the case in the HC group, nonsignificant in the high‐performing SZ group. Even after controlling for inferential logic, results remained constant. 

Contrary to our expectation that LC BOLD activation is positively related to DLPFC and negatively related to PCC BOLD activation in HC but not in patients, we found significant relations between this brainstem structure and the core hub of the ECN as well as DMN in SZ patients. Further, no significant correlations were found in healthy controls. These relations in SZ patients, in particular the low‐performing ones, can be ascribed as a constant effort of the LC‐NE system to sustain or enhance ECN BOLD activation while deactivating DMN activity as a disruptive neuronal network activation. This relation is interpreted in order to optimize the attentional focus to improve or maintain task performance. In contrast, in high‐performing individuals this continuous LC firing is not necessary because an optimal neuronal network interaction might have been initially initiated and maintained over the task. Finally, another explanation might be that LC allocates additional resources when ECN activation alone fails to optimally perform on a task. Thus, low‐performing patients might strongly try to retrieve information from their memory to recall seen letters. In this case, ECN and DMN co‐activation with the LC being the driving structure might be a helpful strategy. 

Some study limitations should be discussed. Although sample sizes seem to be sufficient regarding the overall group analyses, formed subgroups were small, and thus, those results lack power and should be interpreted with some caution. Furthermore, future studies should pay attention to a more balanced sample distribution, especially regarding the ratio between female and male subjects. Moreover, it would be of immense interest to study healthy controls in a low‐performance condition and see whether found neuronal patterns are similar to the ones found in patients. This is necessary to get further insight into the exact role of the LC‐NE system regarding neuronal and large‐scale brain network modulation. Unfortunately, in the present study we were not able to form a low‐performing HC group because just four healthy controls could have assigned to this group. In this context, we want to note another disadvantage of the study. Because of the high‐performance scores, we cannot rule out that task demands were not challenging enough to elucidate the particular role of the LC‐NE system in light of large‐scale brain network modulation. However, task demands allowed the allocation of balanced patient subgroups which lead to very interesting results which should be kept in mind. Furthermore, to analyze dynamic changes in neuronal activation over the entire length of the task as well as condition‐specific, an event‐related design would be most helpful. Thus, the dynamic role of the LC‐NE system and its relation to large‐scale brain networks could be determined further. Another limitation is the analysis of merely medicated patients with schizophrenia. Although we described patient subgroups in terms of drug treatment and found no significant differences in their distribution, an influence of medication on neuronal networks and corresponding neurotransmitter systems cannot be excluded. Accordingly, future studies should examine sufficiently large subgroups with respect to drug therapy to better understand the influence of psychopharmacological treatment on neuronal networks and neurotransmitter systems. Nevertheless, in our present study we divided the sample in high‐ and low‐performing patients and found differences even though patient subgroups did not differ in terms of CPZ equivalent doses, drug distribution, or psychopathology. 

In conclusion, our study adds to the growing body of research that demonstrates that higher‐order tasks cannot be attributed to a single neural network. Instead, proper cognitive function depends on the coordinated activity of multiple brain networks in a flexible fashion, most probable being driven by the LC‐NE system. 

However, one should keep in mind that we have only considered one memory task and that we observed correlations which do not allow causal conclusions. Nonetheless, present results indicate interesting patterns of network interactions and, thus, can be considered as a basis for subsequent studies allowing deeper insights using approaches such as network‐based analyses, Granger Causality, or Dynamic Causal Modeling.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
The   DISC1   gene is one of the most relevant susceptibility genes for psychosis. However, the complex genetic landscape of this locus, which includes protective and risk variants in interaction, may have hindered consistent conclusions on how   DISC1   contributes to schizophrenia (SZ) liability. Analysis from haplotype approaches and brain-based phenotypes can contribute to understanding   DISC1   role in the neurobiology of this disorder. We assessed the brain correlates of   DISC1   haplotypes associated with SZ through a functional neuroimaging genetics approach. First, we tested the association of two   DISC1   haplotypes, the HEP1 (rs6675281-1000731-rs999710) and the HEP3 (rs151229-rs3738401), with the risk for SZ in a sample of 138 healthy subjects (HS) and 238 patients. This approach allowed the identification of three haplotypes associated with SZ (HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA). Second, we explored whether these haplotypes exerted differential effects on n-back associated brain activity in a subsample of 70 HS compared to 70 patients (diagnosis × haplotype interaction effect). These analyses evidenced that HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA modulated working memory functional response conditional to the health/disease status in the cuneus, precuneus, middle cingulate cortex and the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Our results are the first to show a diagnosis-based effect of   DISC1   haplotypes on working memory-related brain activity, emphasising its role in SZ.

## Introduction 
  
The   Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1   gene (  DISC1  ) was first recognised in the context of psychiatric illness when a balanced chromosomal translocation (1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) was found to segregate with major mental disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) . Since then, molecular investigations have highlighted that the liability of the   DISC1   gene towards psychosis is mediated by the protein role in processes associated with the pathophysiology of SZ, such as neurodevelopment and neurosignalling . In neurodevelopment, the DISC1 protein acts as a central coordinator of neuronal trafficking, enabling the proper delivery of a range of neuronal cargoes with spatial and temporal precision, thereby ensuring normal neuronal development and functional homeostasis . More specifically, DISC1 is involved in many stages of neurogenesis, such as neural precursor proliferation, neuronal migration, and neuronal integration/maturation . Also, the synaptic location of DISC1 in adult dendritic spines and its enrichment in the post-synaptic density have suggested a role in the functional regulation of synaptic plasticity , which is supported by several studies that show synaptic plasticity impairments in a variety of different DISC1 mouse mutant models . Finally, it is worth mentioning that DISC1 protein interacts directly with the dopamine D2 receptor , the main target of antipsychotic medications, suggesting that functional changes in the   DISC1   sequence could interfere with dopamine signalling and antipsychotic drug response. Overall, these data indicate that any factor that compromises normal DISC1 function will likely impact brain development and create neurosignalling deficits . 

After identifying the   DISC1   translocation, numerous genetic association studies and meta-analyses have also provided support for the role of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations at this gene in the risk for SZ , as well as in other mental disorders and psychosis-related traits . Additionally, recent data has shown lower   DISC1   expression levels in patients with SZ, which, in turn, were associated with increased severity of symptoms . Therefore, the   DISC1   gene is currently considered one of the most relevant susceptibility genes for psychosis . However, while many genes identified through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in SZ form part of the   DISC1   regulome and interactome , this gene has never been identified through genome-wide approaches by itself . This lack of direct GWAS significance may be due to the   DISC1   genetic structure, which is complex and includes protective and risk single-SNP variants . Efforts to characterise such complexity have identified epistatic effects among   DISC1   polymorphisms on the susceptibility towards SZ , bipolar disorder, psychosis-related traits, and emotional liability . As well, from haplotype-based approaches, the combined effect of different alleles has been related to risk and protective effects towards SZ and schizoaffective disorders , confirming the interest in analysing the   DISC1   variability considering its haplotypic structure. In this sense, among the haplotypes more robustly associated with psychosis are the so-called HEP3 haplotype (spanning at intron 1/exon 2), which includes the rs751229 and the rs3738401, and the HEP1 haplotype (spanning at exon 9/intron 9), which includes SNPs such as the rs6675281, the rs1000731 and the rs999710 . 

To better comprehend this complex genetic landscape and how   DISC1   contributes to SZ, strategies based on quantifiable brain-derived phenotypes have been proposed . On the one hand, many studies have reported associations between different   DISC1   SNPs and brain structural variations in adults and neonates , in line with the pivotal role of   DISC1   in neurodevelopment. On the other hand,   DISC1   variability has been found to affect cognitive performance in domains such as attention and working memory , and the brain functional response to executive function and memory tasks . From functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, among the regions where   DISC1   functional effects have been typically described, we can highlight the hippocampal region  and the prefrontal cortex . These areas, indeed, have been critically involved in both the functional response to memory and attention tasks , and SZ itself . Considering all the above mentioned together with GWAS data showing that several genomic regions associated with SZ have been related to working memory , this cognitive domain is a recognised intermediate phenotype to study SZ's neurobiological basis. Accordingly, studying the   DISC1   correlates of working memory at a brain level through fMRI might shed light on the disorder's brain functional changes. 

Compared with the amount of research based on single polymorphic   DISC1   variants (reviewed Johnstone et al. 2011 and Duff et al. 2013 ), the research based on   DISC1   haplotypic variability is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have related   DISC1   haplotypes to cortical grey matter reductions in healthy subjects and patients with SZ . Similarly, its haplotypic variability was associated with short- and long-term memory impairments . Nonetheless, there is no data on the role of   DISC1   haplotypes on fMRI brain phenotypes which may help bridge the gap between the previously detected effects at the brain structural and cognitive level and the altered neurobiological basis in patients. 

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the brain activity correlates of   DISC1   haplotypic variants associated with SZ through a neuroimaging (fMRI) genetics study. First, we conducted a case–control approach to identify the haplotypes associated with SZ in our sample. Then, we explored whether these haplotypes exerted their effect by differentially modulating working memory cognitive processes during the performance of the n-back task depending on health/disease status. 


## Results 
  
### Genetic association study 
  
First, in our sample of 138 healthy subjects (HS) and 238 subjects with a diagnosis of SZ, our analysis at   DISC1   haplotypic level revealed three haplotypes associated with the risk for the disorder. The haplotypes HEP1-CTG and HEP3-GA were more frequent in HS than in patients, while the HEP3-AA haplotype was significantly overrepresented in patients (Table  ).   
Haplotypic association results. Only those haplotypes showing significant frequency differences between healthy subjects (n = 138) and patients with SZ (n = 238) are reported in this table. The haplotype allelic combinations and the corresponding frequencies are shown for each group, as well as the logistic regression statistic (Wald, W), the   p   value (obtained after applying 10,000 permutations procedure) and the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). 
  


### Neuroimaging association study 
  
Based on the   DISC1   haplotypes associated with SZ, we performed the neuroimaging analysis with the haplotypes HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA in a subsample of 70 HS and 70 patients (groups matched for age, sex and estimated IQ). The haplotypes were dichotomised, and each subject was defined as a carrier of 0 or 1/2 copies of the protective/risk haplotypes. Subsequently, the diagnosis x haplotype interactions were tested on n-back functional response and behavioural performance. 

#### N-back functional response 
  
While the haplotype × diagnosis status interactions were assessed in all the n-back contrasts (1-back vs baseline, 2-back vs baseline and 2-back vs 1-back), we focused on the 2-back vs baseline and 2-back vs 1-back findings because these contrasts are the ones better depicting working memory networks . 

The HEP1-CTG × diagnosis interaction revealed no significant results. Concerning the HEP3, we found that both haplotypic combinations interacted with diagnosis and modulated n-back functional response. In the case of the HEP3-GA haplotype, the interaction was significant in the 1-back vs baseline (fully described in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig.  ) and the 2-back vs baseline contrasts. 

As regards the 2-back vs baseline contrast, one significant cluster of interaction was seen, involving the cuneus and precuneus medially and the right middle cingulate cortex and the superior parietal cortex (735 voxels, peak activation at Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates system (MNI) [-4,-66,72], Z = 3.2,   p   = 0.0182). For interpretation of the direction of the interaction results, the mean activation scores were estimated from the areas where significance was detected, and the mean values were plotted. The mean activations of the region of interest (ROI) indicated that the patients with SZ carrying no copies of the protective HEP3-GA exhibited higher activation scores than those with 1or 2 copies. In contrast, the HS showed the opposite pattern (Fig.  ).

When the HEP3-AA haplotype was assessed, we found a significant interaction with the diagnosis in all the analysed contrasts (for 1-back vs baseline contrast results, see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig.  ). In the 2-back vs baseline, the diagnosis and HEP3-AA interaction was significant in three clusters: cluster (1) was in the left middle and posterior cingulate cortex, extending to the cuneus, precuneus, the thalamus and the paracentral lobule (850 voxels, peak activation at MNI [-22,-40,28], Z = 4.10,   p   = 0.008); cluster (2) was in the right hemisphere including the postcentral and supramarginal gyrus, the middle cingulate cortex, the paracentral lobule and also reaching, the hippocampus (930 voxels, peak activation at MNI [38,-4,28], Z = 3.70,   p   = 0.00464); and, cluster (3) involved regions of the lingual and fusiform gyri on the left, the calcarine sulcus and the cerebellum (1348 voxels, peak activation at MNI [-28,-72,10], Z = 4.06,   p   = 0.000333). In this contrast, ROI analysis revealed that for the three clusters, the HS and the patients with SZ showed similar activity profiles when they had no copies of the HEP3-AA risk haplotype. Conversely, among individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the risk haplotype, HS showed increased activation than patients with SZ, who deactivated these regions. The mean activation scores for cluster 2 are shown in Fig.  .

In the 2-back vs 1-back contrast, a significant interaction emerged in one cluster located in the right superior and middle frontal cortex, the middle and inferior orbitofrontal cortex and the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (585 voxels, peak activation at MNI [48,44,-16], Z = 3.83,   p   = 0.0441). Within individuals with no copies of the risk HEP3-AA haplotype, there were barely any differences between the HS and the SZ patients. However, among individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the HEP3-AA risk haplotype, the response was in opposite directions depending on the diagnosis: HS with 1 or 2 risk copies responded with an activity increase, whereas patients showed minimal changes (Fig.  ).

#### N-back behavioural performance 
  
The signal detection theory index of sensitivity (d') was the behavioural measure used (d'1 for 1-back and d'2 for 2-back). Higher values of d' indicate a better execution of the task. The comparison between HS and patients with SZ revealed significant differences at both n-back difficulty levels (d'1: F = 12.85,   p   < 0.001, d'2: F = 37.31,   p   < 0.001). Patients' performance was significantly worse than the HS' one, and the differences were more pronounced for d'2 scores (d'1 estimated marginal mean (SE) for HS: 4.24 (0.11) and for patients: 3.71 (0.11); d'2 estimated marginal mean (SE) in HS: 3.30 (0.09) and patients: 2.48 (0.09)). The interaction between the associated haplotypes and diagnosis revealed no significant results. 




## Discussion 
  
This study explored whether   DISC1   haplotypic variability exerted differential effects on working memory-related brain activity. We evidenced the association of three   DISC1   haplotypes with SZ (HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA) and subsequently the modulating role of HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA on brain activations during the performance of the n-back task depending on the health/disease status. 

Our genetic association results add to previous research on the involvement of   DISC1   haplotypic variability in the risk for SZ and other psychotic disorders . On the one hand, our data revealed that the HEP1-CTG (rs6675281, rs1000731 and rs999710) was associated with a protective effect (  i.e.,   less frequent in patients than in HS). In line with these data, a HEP1 haplotype containing rs6675281-C and rs1000731-T alleles was identified to be underrepresented in patients with a schizoaffective disorder through a case–control study . Contrary, from a family-based approach, the opposite combination (rs6675281-T allele and rs1000731-C allele) was over-transmitted to the patients with SZ . On the other hand, our findings also indicated the protective effect of the HEP3-GA (rs751229, rs3738401) and the risk effect of the HEP3-AA (  i.e.,   more frequent in patients as compared to HS). In this view, previous studies have likewise reported HEP3-AA to be more frequent in patients with a psychotic disorder than in their relatives . Nonetheless, it is of note that the allelic variants conforming HEP1 and HEP3 and the relative frequencies observed in patients and HS are not always in consensus across studies . Such divergencies could be due to the sample origin (closely related to the haplotypic structure), the association designs, and the differences in the diagnostic criteria at inclusion. Still, what became evident from a study aiming to retrieve consistent results on how   DISC1   variability contributes to SZ's liability was that the locus contains both risk and protective SNPs and haplotypes . 

Our genetic association analyses identified the haplotypic combinations related to SZ in our sample, leading to the assessment of their influence on brain functional differences in HS and patients with SZ. Through the fMRI analyses, we found no significant interaction between diagnosis and HEP1-CTG on n-back brain function. Given the scarce previous studies, a direct comparison of our results with others is not possible. However, it can be noted that one study reported changes in cortical thickness in the left supramarginal gyrus associated with a rare   DISC1   haplotype containing the rs6675281-C allele . 

With reference to HEP3, the two haplotypic combinations revealed significant interactions with the diagnosis on n-back brain response. The interaction between the HEP3-GA and diagnosis in both 1-back vs baseline and 2-back vs baseline implicated the cuneus, the precuneus and the middle cingulate cortex. We observed that HS deactivated such regions and that patients with no copies of the protective GA haplotype had a less marked deactivation or even failed to deactivate in the most difficult level (2-back vs baseline). Considering that our association findings related the GA haplotype to a protective effect towards the disorder, this neuroimaging result seems to be in the same direction. The precuneus forms part of the so-called default mode network, a network of regions that HS deactivate during the performance of a wide range of cognitive tasks  and its failure of deactivation during the performance of the n-back and other tasks has also been reported in several studies in SZ . Additionally, changes in the precuneus structure and functional connectivity in SZ have been previously related to   DISC1   genetic variability . 

As regards the HEP3-AA, the interaction has been observed in all the n-back contrasts analysed. This suggests that the HEP3-AA haplotype modulates the different cognitive requirements engaged during the n-back . Concerning the 2-back vs baseline contrast, the interaction was found in regions related to the previously described HEP3-GA interaction, comprising the precuneus, the posterior and middle cingulate cortex and the cuneus. This suggests that, regardless of the haplotypic combination, the HEP3 haplotype may be involved in the functional response of these brain regions. In detail, we observed that among patients with SZ, those without the protective GA haplotype and those with the risk AA haplotype were the ones presenting activation patterns in opposite directions compared to the rest of the individuals. Since the haplotypes were dichotomised, eight individuals had 1 copy of each of the two haplotypes (1 of the protective HEP3-GA and the other of the risk HEP3-AA). To overcome this haplotypic overlap, we retested the interactions with the estimated mean activity scores once these subjects were removed from the analyses, and the results remained unchanged. 

In the 2-back vs 1-back contrast, the regions with significant HEP3-AA interaction with diagnosis included the right ventrolateral and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Previously,   DISC1   variability has been found to modulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in response to working memory in healthy subjects . Likewise, a functional neuroimaging meta-analysis of different executive and working memory tasks found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and the right ventrolateral and premotor cortex were involved in these cognitive demanding tasks and also that their activation was reduced in SZ . Considering the HEP3-AA neuroimaging results together, the most distinctive pattern occurred within HS carrying 1 or 2 copies of this risk haplotype compared to the others (HS without it and all the patients). This pattern arises from the larger absolute degree of brain activity change observed between HS carriers and non-carriers of the risk haplotype, compared to the degree of change detected within patients. Such differential effect of diagnosis has already been highlighted by Crespi & Badcock  when reviewing the complex relationship between genetic factors and SZ intermediate phenotypes. 

About the n-back behavioural analyses, we did not detect significant interaction effects between the diagnosis and either of the haplotypes. In this sense, the comparability of the results is hampered because previous studies assessing   DISC1   variability on working memory do not report   DISC1   behavioural analyses evaluated during fMRI protocols . However, one fMRI study is partially in line with our data, as they did not detect an effect of the   DISC1   on behavioural performance when analysing one SNP at HEP1 (rs6675281) and a different working memory task . Beyond functional studies, neurocognitive evidence has associated a rare 4-SNP haplotype (including the HEP3) with visuospatial working memory . Then, the results in our sample could be interpreted from the perspective that the genetic variability effect at the behavioural level is less penetrant than at the brain activity level , and further analyses in larger samples will be needed to furtherly explore the relationship between fMRI and behavioural data. 

Regarding the effects of HEP3 haplotype on gene expression, it has been highlighted that the regions covered by this haplotype are highly conserved after human and mouse divergence, and the fact that these noncoding regions have such evolutionary conservation may be indicative of some functional significance and/or a potential regulatory role . Furthermore, the rs3738401-G/A polymorphism, located in exon 2  ,   is a missense variant that causes an Arg264Gln aminoacidic substitution. It has been reported that this polymorphism has a biological impact on Wnt signalling transduction pathways affecting neurogenesis , suggesting a putative mechanism for its role in decisive neurodevelopmental processes leading to psychiatric disorders. So, our results on the modulation effect that   DISC1   haplotypic variability has on brain function would link the evidence highlighting the role of   DISC1   in neurogenesis with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SZ. 

Finally, some limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, for the genetic association analysis, our sample could be regarded as quite small; nonetheless, the fact that we inspected the haplotypic instead of single SNP variability adds power to our approach. Also, with 70 patients and 70 controls, our sample is large for functional imaging standards considering that most of the previous studies are focused exclusively on HS  or include a reduced group of patients . On the other hand, the fact that the neuroimaging analyses were based on our haplotypic association results represents a strength of the study. Notwithstanding, future studies performed in larger samples and higher resolution scanners would be desirable. Finally, we must consider that variables related exclusively to the illness status could not be included in the interaction analysis. With this in mind, we checked within patients the possible impact of PANSS score or medication on the mean activity and the d' scores through regressions, with none of them reaching significance. 

In conclusion, our data add to previous findings of an association of the HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA haplotypes with SZ susceptibility. Additionally, this study shows, for the first time, evidence of the effect of   DISC1   haplotypic variability on brain functional differences between patients affected by SZ and HS. Although further studies are needed, our data suggest a putative role of the   DISC1   gene in the altered functional and behavioural substrates of SZ associated with n-back task performance. This might, in turn, contribute to closing the gap between the role of this gene in neurodevelopment and the pathophysiological underpinnings of schizophrenia. 


## Methods 
  
### Sample 
  
The genetic association analysis to identify   DISC1   haplotypes related to SZ was conducted in a sample of 138 healthy subjects (HS) and 238 subjects with a DMS-IV-TR diagnosis of SZ (based on interviews by two psychiatrists). All participants were of European ancestry, between 19 and 65 years old. There were group differences regarding sex (χ  = 15.85   p   < 0.001, 72% males within patients with SZ and 51% within HS) and age (t = − 2.65   p   = 0.008, mean age (SD) for patients with SZ = 41.98 (11.81) and for HS = 38.65 (11.64)). The HS had no personal or family history of psychiatric disorders or treatment. All participants met the same exclusion criteria: co-existent neurological disorder or medical illness affecting brain function, history of head trauma with loss of consciousness and history of drug abuse or dependence. 

The neuroimaging analyses were performed in a subsample of 70 HS and 70 patients matched for age, sex, and estimated IQ (premorbid IQ in the patients), as assessed using the Word Accentuation Test (  Test de acentuación de palabras,   TAP ) (Table  ). In addition to the previous inclusion criteria, all participants in this part of the study were right-handed and had an estimated IQ ≥ 70. Symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS ).   
Sample description. Information on the healthy subjects (HS) and patients with SZ included in the neuroimaging association study. Sex description includes male:female count (frequency in males). The clinical description of patients includes Illness duration (in years), the PANSS scores, and chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent dose (mg/day). All the quantitative variables include the mean value and (standard deviation). 
  
Data of illness duration was available for 67 patients. 

Data of PANSS scores and CPZ equivalents were available for 65 patients. 
  

Ethical approval was obtained from the Germanes Hospitalàries Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent about the study procedures and implications. All procedures were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Genotyping and haplotype estimation 
  
Genomic DNA was extracted for all individuals either from buccal mucosa through cotton swabs using ATP Genomic Mini Kit Tissue (Taknokroma Analitica, S.A., Sant Cugat del Vallès, Span) or peripheral blood cells using Realpure SSS kit (Durviz, S.L.U., Valencia, Spain). The set of SNPs was selected according to previous studies in which   DISC1   haplotypes associated with SZ were described . Two SNPs within the HEP3 haplotype (rs751229 and rs3738401) and three SNPs within the HEP1 haplotype (rs6675281, rs1000731 and rs999710) were genotyped (Table  ). The allelic discrimination was performed using a fluorescence-based procedure (Applied Biosystems Taqman 5 ‘-exonuclease assays) using standard conditions, and the polymerase chain reaction plates were read on ABI PRISM 7900HT instrument with SDS v2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The genotyping call rate was > 0.97, and the method's accuracy was retested by running in duplicate 10% of the samples and confirming all the repeated genotypes. All SNPs were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both diagnostic groups. The minor allele frequencies in our sample were similar to that described for the European population in the 1000 Genomes Project. There were no differences between the SNPs/haplotype frequencies from the whole sample and the neuroimaging subsample. For the neuroimaging approach, the estimation and tabulation of the individual haplotype phases were performed using PLINK 1.07 .   
Haplotype description. The description includes the #rs of the   DISC1   SNPs, the chromosomal and gene position (GRCh38), the alleles of each SNP (major/minor allele), the minor allele frequency (MAF) observed in the European population from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), and the MAF observed in the genetic association sample (138 HS and 238 patients with SZ). 
  


### N-back task description and behavioural response 
  
Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were obtained while participants performed a sequential-letter version of the n-back task . This functional paradigm engages storage and executive processes related to attention and memory . The task had two levels of memory load (the 1-back and the 2-back), and as the difficulty load increases, higher-order executive functions like working memory become more relevant . Since working memory is a cognitive dimension where patients affected by SZ exhibit affectations , we focused on the contrasts better characterising the working memory network, which, according to recent independent component analysis, are the 2-back vs baseline and the 2-back vs 1-back contrasts . 

The two memory load levels were presented in a blocked design manner. Each block consisted of 24 letters that were shown every 2 seconds (1 second on, 1 second off). All blocks contained five repetitions (one letter beforehand in the 1-back version and two letters beforehand in the 2-back version) located randomly within the blocks. Individuals had to indicate repetitions by pressing a button. Four 1-back and four 2-back blocks were presented in an interleaved way, and between them, a baseline stimulus (an asterisk flashing with the same frequency as the letters) was presented for 16 seconds. Characters were shown in green and red for 1-back and 2-back, respectively, to identify which task had to be performed. The same day, before the scanning session, all participants underwent a training session outside the scanner. 

The behavioural measure used was the signal detection theory index of sensitivity, d' . Higher values of d' indicate a better ability to discriminate between targets and distractors, while negative values indicate that subjects are not performing the task. All the individuals included in the analyses had positive d' values (d'1 for 1-back and d'2 for 2-back). 


### Neuroimaging data acquisition 
  
In each scanning session, 266 volumes were acquired from a GE Sigma 1.5-T scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). A gradient echo-planar imaging sequence depicted the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. Each volume contained 16 axial planes acquired with the following parameters: repetition time = 2000 ms., echo time = 20 ms., flip angle = 70°, section thickness = 7 mm, section skip = 0.7 mm, in-plane resolution = 3 × 3 mm. To avoid T1 saturation effects, the first 10 volumes were discarded. 


### Statistical analyses 
  
#### Genetic association study 
  
We tested all the possible allelic combinations for the two haplotypes assessed (HEP1 and HEP3) for association with SZ through a logistic regression model, including sex as a covariate (PLINK). The given   p   values are those obtained after 10,000 permutations procedure. Only those haplotypes significantly associated with the disorder were furtherly examined in the neuroimaging association study. 


#### Neuroimaging association study 
  
Based on our genetic association results, we performed the neuroimaging analysis with the HEP1-CTG, the HEP3-GA and the HEP3-AA in the matched subsample of 70 HS and 70 patients. Because of the haplotypic frequencies in our sample, the analyses were conducted considering all haplotypes as dichotomous variables and each subject was defined as a carrier of 0 or 1/2 copies of the protective/risk haplotypes. 

The fMRI analyses were performed with the FEAT tool from FSL software (FMRIB Software, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK ). Images were corrected for movement and co-registered to a common stereotactic space (the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template). Subjects with an estimated maximum absolute movement > 3.0 mm or an average absolute movement > 0.3 mm were a priori excluded from the study to minimise unwanted movement-related effects. Normalised volumes were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 5 mm full-width at half maximum, and general linear models were fitted to generate individual activation maps for three different contrasts: 1-back vs baseline, 2-back vs baseline, and 2-back vs 1-back. The movement variables were added to the model as nuisance variables to control for movement in the scanner. All statistical tests were performed at the cluster level with a corrected   p   value of 0.05 and an initial height threshold of 2.3 (equivalent to an uncorrected   p   value of 0.01, using the Standard Field Theory correction implemented in FSL ). Afterwards, the interaction effect on brain function between the diagnosis and the three haplotypes was tested using regression models (whole-brain corrected and controlled for age, sex and estimated IQ). For interpretation of the direction of the interaction results, the mean activation scores were estimated from the areas where significance was detected with the FSLSTATS tool in FSL, and the mean values were plotted using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23.0, released 2015, IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York). The mean activity scores obtained from the 2-back vs 1-back contrast do not represent the mean activation per se, but the mean activation change occurring from 1-back to 2-back levels. 

Analyses of the behavioural data were carried out using SPSS. First, n-back task performance (d'1 and d'2) was compared between HS and patients using an ANOVA (controlling for age, sex and estimated IQ). Next, the interaction between diagnosis and the three haplotypes was tested through full-factorial ANOVAs (including the diagnosis and haplotype main effects and controlled for age, sex and estimated IQ). These analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits contribute strongly to disability in schizophrenia, and are resistant to existing medications. Recent drug development has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable patients with schizophrenia (n=26 analyzed). We focused on 3T fMRI response in frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p<0.0001) and anterior cingulate/paracingulate (p=0.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative symptom scores (r=−0.42, p=0.031), and exploratory correlations suggested broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism which may benefit an important subset of individuals with schizophrenia. Imaging biomarkers may reveal therapeutic mechanisms, and help guide treatment towards specific populations.

## Introduction 
  
Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as amotivation and flat affect, are prevalent and contribute to disability and poor outcomes [ ]. Negative symptoms are also resistant to existing treatments, creating a critical need for novel therapeutic targets and agents [ ]. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are also prominent, disabling, and treatment resistant [ ], and there are important interactions between motivational and cognitive deficits at both psychological and neurobiological levels [ – ]. In particular, both cognitive and motivational impairments are linked to dysfunction in frontostriatal circuitry. This circuitry includes dorsolateral and anterior cingulate regions in the prefrontal cortex, which are critical for executive functions such as working memory, and ventral and dorsal striatal regions linked to motivation and reinforcement learning [ ,  ]. In fMRI reward tasks, hypofunction in striatum correlates with global negative symptom severity, and amotivation specifically [ – ]. Hypofunction in ventral and dorsal striatum and connected prefrontal regions is also associated with schizophrenia and negative symptoms during working memory and other cognitive fMRI paradigms [ – ]. 

Blockade of dopamine receptors is the primary mechanism of all existing antipsychotics, and this blockade may have competing positive and negative effects on both negative symptoms and cognition [ ,  ]. Inspired by the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia pathophysiology, more recent drug development efforts have focused on ameliorating putative deficits in NMDA signaling [ ,  ]. Interest has been fueled by multiple studies in rodents showing positive effects of agonism at type II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) and mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) in NMDA-antagonist models of psychosis, including improvements in cognition and motivation [ – ]. In a rodent functional imaging study, an mGluR2 PAM opposed the effects of NMDA-antagonists in specific brain regions including prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral striatum, and mediodorsal thalamus [ ], and an mGluR2-selective agonist reduced ketamine-induced fMRI abnormalities in healthy humans [ ]. The mGluR2 receptor is thus a promising target for modulating frontostriatal circuitry and improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. 

The extent to which mGluR2 signaling impacts cognitive or reward function in humans remains largely unknown. On the strength of preclinical studies, mGluR2/3 agonists and more recently mGluR2 PAMs have been brought into clinical trials in schizophrenia [ ,  ] and other psychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. These trials have demonstrated an excellent safety profile of mGluR 2/3 agonists and modulators, but their efficacy in reducing symptoms has been inconsistent. Encouraging initial efforts, the mGluR2/3 agonist pomaglumetad improved both negative and positive symptoms in the first large-scale trial [ ]. However, later clinical trials with pomeglumetad did not show consistent benefits [ ,  ]. Two different mGluR 2/3 agonists reduced ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in healthy volunteers [ ]. An mGluR2 PAM (ADX/JNJ) also reduced ketamine-induced negative symptoms in healthy volunteers [ ], but only trend improvement was found in a preliminary study of schizophrenia associated with prominent residual negative symptoms [ ]. The single published clinical trial in schizophrenia with the mGluR2 PAM studied here (AZD8529) did not improve symptoms or cognition [ ]. 

It remains unclear why the promise of these agents has so far not been borne out in clinical trials, but the field is at risk of prematurely discarding an intervention that could still benefit an important subset of patients. Heterogeneity of individual response is likely to be a major contributor to negative clinical trials [ ,  ]. Indeed, re-analyses of the pomeglumetad schizophrenia trials suggested efficacy in specific subgroups, including those in early stages of illness (< 3 years) and those whose antipsychotic treatment had included dopamine D2 blockade but not serotonin 5HT2A blockade [ ]. There is some evidence for inverted U-shaped dose response curves with mGluR2 PAMs [ ], and individual differences in drug metabolism or sensitivity could impede identification of effects averaged across a sample. 

Further progress in understanding this heterogeneity, evaluating early signals of efficacy, and predicting clinical effects will require greater understanding of drug effects on specific neural circuits, and development of neurophysiological biomarkers such as pharmacological fMRI (phMRI) [ ,  ]. Even when effects are not robust on average, incorporation of neurophysiological biomarkers can reveal brain-behavioral correlations that give insight into drug mechanisms and individual differences in drug response, consistent with the precision medicine and experimental therapeutic approaches advocated by NIMH and others [ ,  ]. 

To date, no imaging studies have been published using mGluR2/3 agonists or modulators in schizophrenia (or any other psychiatric populations). To address this gap and gain insight into neural circuit effects and potential response heterogeneity, we performed this phMRI study evaluating adjunctive treatment with the mGluR2 PAM AZD8529. We hypothesized the drug would increase fMRI activation in prefrontal and striatal circuitry, and that this change in activation would correlate with improvement in negative symptoms and cognitive performance. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
45 adult individuals were randomized into the study. After exclusions (See   for inclusion/exclusion criteria and excluded participants), 26 participants (10 female) had complete fMRI data analyzed and reported here. Participants were stable outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=25) or schizoaffective disorder depressed type (n=1), on a stable antipsychotic regimen which was continued throughout the study. Most (n=22) were on 2 /3 -generation antipsychotics, two were on 1st-generation antipsychotics, and two were on both; mean daily dosage was 510±283 mg chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZ). Additional psychotropic medications taken on a routine basis included anticholinergics (n=8), anxiolytics (n=9), antidepressants (n=10), anticonvulsants/lithium (n=4/1), thyroid replacement hormone (n=1). Demographic and clinical characterization of the analyzed sample is included in  . Participants underwent standard medical, neurological, psychiatric, and neurocognitive evaluations (detailed in  ). Participants were provided with a complete description of the study and written informed consent was obtained. All study procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 


### Study drug and design 
  
The adjunctive pharmacological agent used here, AZD8529, is an mGluR2-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM). Like all mGluR2 PAMS, AZD8529 acts on an allosteric site to potentiate mGluR2 activation only in the presence of endogenous glutamate [ ]. The use of direct agonists at mGluR2/3 carries significant limitations for both mechanistic investigation and therapeutic applications, which can be surmounted by the use of PAMs [ ]. Targeting the allosteric site allows selective activation of mGluR2 and not mGluR3, and maintains physiologic activity-dependent receptor activation, which may reduce non-physiological and adverse effects, as well as habituation [ ,  ]. In addition, PAMs including AZD8529 exhibit greater oral bioavailability and CNS penetration than agonists, which enhances their potential clinical utility. The dosing of AZD8529 was 80mg daily for three days, a regimen designed to achieve after 3 days the steady-state level approximating the level from the chronic 40 mg every-other-day dosing used in Litman et al. [ ]. This approximation was based on prior pharmacokinetic studies using various dosing regimens (AZD8529 Multiple Ascending Dose Study D1960C00002, data on file at AstraZeneca); as can be seen in   we achieved average blood levels (112 ng/mL) that were somewhat higher than those reported in Litman et al. (Cmax 73ng/mL, Cmin 38ng/mL) while still well within the range previously determined to be safe and tolerable. 

This was a Phase 1 pilot study, designed and registered in 2009 as   NCT00986531  . The overall design was a double blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced within-subject crossover, with a 14-day washout between drug and placebo phases. Primary outcome measures included fMRI activation and cognitive battery performance; secondary outcomes included EEG, negative and other symptoms from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and safety assessments including vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), suicidality and other adverse events. Key outcome measures were obtained once following 3 days of treatment with oral AZD8529 (80 mg daily), and once following 3 days of treatment with an identical-appearing placebo (see   for details of visit schedule, and   for study design schematic). 

#### Imaging task 
  
During both MRI sessions, subjects completed a previously described fractal n-back task (0, 1, 2, and 3-back block design;  ) [ ]. To minimize practice effects, two equivalent forms of the tasks with unique stimuli were administered in a counterbalanced order. Our primary behavioral measure in the scanner n-back task was   d′  , which summarizes overall task performance while accounting for the number of correct responses and the number of false positives [ ]. Due to technical problems, n-back in-scanner behavioral data was incomplete and excluded for two participants. See   for further fMRI task details. 



### Image acquisition, processing and timeseries analysis 
  
Images were acquired with a Siemens Trio 3T (Erlangen, Germany) system, in the following order: structural, resting perfusion, emotion identification BOLD, continuous performance BOLD, n-back BOLD, B0 map. BOLD fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) within FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library,   www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl  ). Individual-level timeseries analysis was carried out using a general linear model in FSL. A canonical hemodynamic response function was used to model 4 conditions (0-back, 1-back, 2-back, 3-back) with separate regressors; six motion correction parameters were included as nuisance regressors, and rest condition was designated the unmodeled baseline. See   for further acquisition and processing details. 


### Group-level region of interest image analysis 
  
For our primary analysis of group-level effects, a region of interest (ROI) approach was used. Based on the expected intersection of working memory effects and mGluR2 effects within frontostriatal circuitry as described above, we examined three bilateral ROIs: DLPFC, ACC, and striatum (STR). To obtain unbiased functional ROIs we generated 10mm spheres around areas of peak activation from the Neurosynth meta-anlysis of working memory fMRI (see   and   for detailed ROI definitions). For each ROI, individual subject activation measures (contrast parameter estimates, arbitrary units) were extracted for statistical analysis. 


### Group-level exploratory voxelwise analyses 
  
In addition to analysis in these three ROIs, we conducted exploratory whole-brain voxelwise analyses to test for effects outside predicted regions. Individual-level statistical maps were transformed into MNI space and resampled to 2mm isotropic voxels. Drug-placebo fixed effects were calculated within each subject and these contrasts were then subjected to group-level analyses in FSL using FLAME1. All voxelwise analyses were FWE-corrected using 5000 permutations in FSL’s   randomise  , with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)[ ] to ensure rigorous control of multiple comparisons. 


### Mixed model analysis and other statistical tests 
  
Drug effects were examined using a linear mixed effects model (  lmer   procedure) implemented in R version 3.2.5, with participants as a random factor, drug (AZD8529 vs. placebo) as a fixed effect; some analyses included working memory load level as an additional fixed factor. There was no effect of the two n-back task forms on any outcome and so this variable was not included. Descriptive statistics and uncorrected post-hoc t-tests were used to explicate significant results from the mixed models; normality and variance were examined for key variables. Pearsons correlations were used to relate drug-induced change in ROI activation to drug-induced change in symptoms. For all statistical tests, significance was determined using an alpha criterion of p<0.05, two-tailed. 



## Results 
  
### Safety, Clinical Symptoms, Cognitive Performance 
  
Overall, the drug was well-tolerated. There were two serious adverse events, both involving hyperglycemia in participants with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (one on study drug, one on placebo); neither was considered study-related, they were withdrawn from the study. There were no clinically significant ECG abnormalities reported. 

No significant effects of drug were found on PANSS symptoms, out-of scanner cognitive battery overall accuracy (p=0.16), or the   d’   measure of in-scanner n-back performance (p=0.46). The   d’   measure did show an expected effect of worse performance at higher n-back levels (F(3,165)=46.47, p <.0001), with no drug x level interaction (p=0.78). 


### Effects on n-back fMRI activation 
  
BOLD activation showed expected modulation by working memory load in ACC (F(3,178)=5.25, p=0.002) and DLPFC (F(3,178) = 3.14, p=0.027) although load effects were not significant in striatum (F(3,178)=0.92, p=0.43). This pattern reflected increasing activation at higher load levels, although with some reduction at the highest 3-back level ( ). Relative to placebo, drug increased activation across load levels in ACC (F(1, 178) = 10.04, p=0.002) and more dramatically in striatum (F(1,178)=25.4,p<0.0001); no significant effects were seen in DLPFC (F(1, 178)=2.10, p=0.15). No regions showed significant interaction effects of drug with working memory load level (p’s >0.3). Exploratory voxelwise analysis did not identify other regions showing significant drug effects. Participants who showed greater striatal activation by the drug also showed greater reductions in PANSS negative symptom scores (correlation of drug-placebo difference scores, r=−0.42, p=0.031;  ). This relationship with the primary PANSS negative symptom score was not significant in other ROIs and was not accounted for by other PANSS domains; however, exploratory correlations suggested broader drug effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest (see   and   and  ). fMRI findings were not explained by demographic variables, head motion, anxiety, extrapyramidal symptoms, or other potential confounds (see  ). 



## Discussion 
  
Our study is the first to examine the neural circuit effects of enhancing mGluR2 functioning in schizophrenia. Applying the mGluR2 PAM AZD8529 during working memory fMRI, we find that AZD8529 increases activation in task-activated frontostriatal regions (significantly in STR and ACC with a non-significant trend in DLPFC), and also observe that the magnitude of increased activation in striatum correlates with reduction in negative symptoms. 

There has been a single published schizophrenia clinical trial with AZD8529, which did not show benefits of chronic dosing (28 days) on positive or negative symptoms or cognition [ ]. Here we also find no average effects of briefer treatment (3 days) with AZD8529 on these domains. However, our inclusion of fMRI measures allowed us to identify drug effects at the brain level and understand potential heterogeneity in drug response. This outcome provides support for the experimental medicine approach recently implemented by NIMH [ ,  ], demonstrating that studies that would be “negative” if only standard clinical endpoints were included can be informative when brain-based biomarkers are incorporated. 

The location of our findings is consistent with the known distribution and function of mGluR2 receptors in animal and human studies. mGluR2 expression is high in prefrontal regions including dorsolateral and anterior cingulate and in subcortical regions, particularly striatum, and metabotropic glutamate receptors including mGluR2 modulate glutamatergic function in these regions [ ,  ,  ,  – ]. 

Prior fMRI studies of working memory in schizophrenia typically report reduced task activation, although this effect depends in part on task difficulty [ ]. Here we did not have a healthy control group; however, consistent with most prior literature, our n-back task has previously shown fMRI hypoactivation associated with psychotic symptoms and global psychopathology [ ,  ]. Thus, the increased activation seen here is consistent with a normalization of neural circuit function. However, AZD8529 did not improve working memory performance itself, seemingly reflecting greater sensitivity of fMRI compared to behavior [ ]. It could also indicate that there are other important contributors to impaired behavioral performance that are not impacted by AZD8529, or that higher doses or longer duration of treatment are necessary for clear cognitive benefits. We observed robust drug-induced increases in activation in ACC but not DLPFC; the reason for this difference is unclear, but a stronger increase in DLPFC activity might be needed to achieve cognitive improvement. 

While working memory is most closely associated with prefrontal cortex, striatal regions including the dorsal caudate are also activated during working memory fMRI [ ,  ]. The striatal region showing drug effects correlating with negative symptom change in this study lies within that dorsal caudate area ( ). The same dorsal caudate region exhibits functional connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is reduced in association with duration of untreated psychosis [ ]. Some prior studies have also related impaired dorsal striatal activation to schizophrenia and negative symptoms during working memory fMRI. In particular, Ehrlich et al. [ ] found that higher negative symptom severity in schizophrenia correlated with lower working memory fMRI activation in dorsal striatum (but not significantly in DLPFC). Koch et al. [ ] found reduced dorsal caudate activation during working memory in schizophrenia, but did not examine negative symptoms specifically. More broadly, our results are consistent with the reward imaging literature showing that hypofunction in striatum correlates with negative symptom severity. While most prior studies have focused on the ventral striatum [ ], human and animal studies also link dorsal striatum hypofunction to negative symptoms and amotivation; dorsal striatum may be particular important for the formation of action-reward associations [ ,  ]. 

### Metabotropic glutamate signaling – imaging and schizophrenia 
  
Although our study does not address the question of baseline abnormalities in mGluR2 signaling in schizophrenia, it suggests that enhancing this signaling in striatum improves an mGluR2 signaling deficit either directly, or by compensating for other abnormalities. Existing literature regarding mGluR2 expression abnormalities in schizophrenia is mixed, and expression abnormalities may be limited to early stages of illness [ ], although alterations in function may occur independently of expression levels. Genome-wide association studies to date have identified risk variants in mGluR3, not mGluR2 [ ], but there are poorly-understood interactions between mGluR2 and mGluR3 pathways [ ]. A strength of AZD8529 and other mGluR2-selective PAMS is that unlike direct agonists, effects can be clearly attributed to mGluR2 and not mGluR3, aiding biological interpretability as well as therapeutic specificity. In animal studies, mGluR2 has been shown to interact with other (non-glutamatergic) neurotransmitter systems associated with schizophrenia pathophysiology and/or antipsychotic response including dopamine [ ], serotonin [ ], and GABA [ ]. The mGluR2 effects are thought to be mediated mainly by presynaptic autoreceptors that reduce neurotransmitter release but there is also some post-synaptic expression of mGluR2, perhaps contributing to complex (inverted-U) dose reponses [ ,  ]. Regardless of whether AZD8529 effects are normalizing a pathophysiological hypofunction of mGluR2 signaling or increasing it to supra-normal levels, our results suggest that this effect may be beneficial for ameliorating negative symptoms. 


### Imaging of glutamatergic effects 
  
There is limited work in humans examining effects of glutamatergic signaling on neural circuitry. Most studies have employed the NMDA antagonist ketamine, demonstrating primarily increases in regional cerebral blood flow, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, resting-state connectivity, and glutamate/glutamine spectroscopic levels [ ,  – ]. Studies of ketamine effects on fMRI task-activation have shown variable increases or decreases, including a decrease in striatal reward responses [ ] and dorsolateral prefrontal memory responses [ ,  ]. Task-fMRI ketamine effects also vary according to individual differences such as depression status [ ,  ]. Two studies demonstrated that mGluR2/3 agonists as well as a selective mGluR2 agonist reduced ketamine-induced BOLD [ ,  ]. To our knowledge, no published studies have examined effects of AZD8529 or other mGluR2 PAMs using neuroimaging. One study using EEG found that another mGluR2 PAM altered sleep EEG structure [ ]. Although much more work is needed in this area, overall results suggest that AZD8529 and other agents that increase mGluR2 signaling have effects opposite to those of ketamine. 


### Limitations 
  
There are several limitations in the current study. The sample size is relatively small, and replication in a larger sample will be important. Our study lacked a healthy control group, so we cannot judge to what extent observed drug effects are dependent on baseline brain pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We studied a chronic medicated sample, and all patients were on a medication with potential serotonergic effects, thus we could not examine putatively responsive subgroups of early-stage psychosis and D2-exclusive medication exposure identified by Kinon et al. [ ]. Early-stage schizophrenia may exhibit distinct glutamatergic abnormalities [ ] and more robust clinical response to mGluR agonism [ ], and antipsychotic treatment in our patients may have limited the efficacy of AZD8529, perhaps through downregulating mGluR2 [ ] or inducing D2 supersensitivity [ ]. Future work could examine mGluR2 PAMS in early-stage psychosis and at-risk populations including medication-naive individuals. Patients were also symptomatically stable with relatively low symptom severity; this increased the safety of the study, but may have reduced sensitivity for detecting drug-related improvements. In addition, most of the participants were smokers, so the extent to which findings generalize to nonsmokers is unclear. AZD8529 is also being studied in nicotine and other addictions, and future studies could examine the relationship of the fMRI effects we see to addiction phenotypes. Another limitation is that our design did not include long-term treatment with AZD8529 as would be needed for actual clinical use. Although we selected a dose designed to approximate over 3 days the steady-state level expected from chronic dosing, medications may have long-term or indirect effects that take weeks to emerge even at steady-state. We only used a single dose, and mGluR2 PAMs may show complex/inverted-U dose responses. This would be expected to obscure average drug effects at a given dose given inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. While we show that some clinical response heterogeneity is related to heterogeneity in brain responses, this leaves open the question of what factors drive these differences in brain response, pointing to the need for future work examining different stages of illness and different medication exposures. Aspects of our study design that substantially limit our ability to address questions of specificity regarding negative symptoms and the role of motivation circuitry include: use of the PANSS for our primary negative symptom measure since current cutting edge measures such as CAINS and BNSS were not fully developed at time of study design; the lack of a measure of primary/deficit negative symptoms or a specific depression measure; and lack of an fMRI task directly manipulating reward. Lastly, the test-retest reliability of fMRI and hence its sensitivity to drug effects is generally higher in task-activated regions [ ], so we cannot rule out drug effects in other regions that would be better detected with other imaging tasks or task-free fMRI approaches. 


### Summary & Conclusions 
  
Notwithstanding these limitations, our findings from the first fMRI study of mGluR2 modulation in schizophrenia support further investigation of this pharmacological mechanism. In particular, our findings suggest the potential of increased mGluR2 signaling to improve disabling symptoms of schizophrenia by activating fronto-striatal brain regions. Our results also support the future development of fMRI and other imaging biomarkers to reveal therapeutic mechanisms and tailor drug development and treatment towards specific neural circuits and patient populations. Ultimately, this effort will move us towards the ultimate goal of personalized medicine with optimal outcomes for every patient.
