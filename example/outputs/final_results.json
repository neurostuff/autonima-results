      "title": "Working memory in schizophrenia: The role of the locus coeruleus and its relation to functional brain networks.",
      "abstract": "Evidence suggests functional brain networks, especially the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN), to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Dysfunctions within the locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenaline (NE) system, which is supposed to be pivotal to modulate neuronal network activation during executive control (e.g., working memory function), are also considered to play a vital role in the occurrence of positive (e.g., hallucinatory) or negative (e.g., inattentive) symptoms in these patients. In the present study, we sought to shed further light on the role of the LC-NE system in patients with schizophrenia. More specifically, we wanted to improve our understanding of the relationship and possible disturbances of the ECN and DMN during a working memory task in patients. A total of 58 healthy control subjects and 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia were investigated using a working memory 3-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Main findings of our present study were differential dynamics of ECN and DMN blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activations with increasing task demands in both patients and controls. Moreover, we found increased BOLD activation in the LC in patients compared to controls in the interaction contrast between groups and conditions. LC BOLD activation significantly correlated with both, the main hub of the ECN, that is, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and of the DMN, that is, the posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, the LC-NE system seems to be crucial in modulating neuronal network activity in a 3-back working memory task and might significantly contribute to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "The DISC1 gene\u00a0is one of the most relevant susceptibility genes for psychosis. However, the complex genetic landscape of this locus, which includes protective and risk variants in interaction, may have hindered consistent conclusions on how DISC1 contributes to schizophrenia (SZ) liability. Analysis from haplotype approaches and brain-based phenotypes can contribute to understanding DISC1 role in the neurobiology of this\u00a0disorder. We assessed the brain correlates of DISC1 haplotypes associated with SZ through a functional neuroimaging genetics approach. First, we tested the association of two DISC1 haplotypes, the HEP1 (rs6675281-1000731-rs999710) and the HEP3 (rs151229-rs3738401), with the risk for SZ in a sample of 138 healthy subjects (HS) and 238 patients. This approach allowed the identification of three haplotypes associated with SZ (HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA). Second, we explored whether these haplotypes exerted differential effects on n-back associated brain activity in a subsample of 70 HS compared to 70 patients (diagnosis\u2009\u00d7\u2009haplotype interaction effect). These analyses evidenced that HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA modulated working memory functional response conditional to the health/disease status in the cuneus, precuneus, middle cingulate cortex and the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Our results are the first to show a diagnosis-based effect of DISC1 haplotypes on working memory-related brain activity, emphasising its role in SZ.",

      "abstract": "Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide switching between activity states using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia pathophysiology.",

      "title": "Origins of spatial working memory deficits in schizophrenia: an event-related FMRI and near-infrared spectroscopy study.",
      "abstract": "Abnormal prefrontal functioning plays a central role in the working memory (WM) deficits of schizophrenic patients, but the nature of the relationship between WM and prefrontal activation remains undetermined. Using two functional neuroimaging methods, we investigated the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting in schizophrenic and healthy participants. We focused on the brain activation during WM maintenance phase with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also examined oxygenated hemoglobin changes in relation to memory performance with the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using the same spatial WM task. Distinct types of correct and error trials were segregated for analysis. fMRI data indicated that prefrontal activation was increased during WM maintenance on correct trials in both schizophrenic and healthy subjects. However, a significant difference was observed in the functional asymmetry of frontal activation pattern. Healthy subjects showed increased activation in the right frontal, temporal and cingulate regions. Schizophrenic patients showed greater activation compared with control subjects in left frontal, temporal and parietal regions as well as in right frontal regions. We also observed increased 'false memory' errors in schizophrenic patients, associated with increased prefrontal activation and resembling the activation pattern observed on the correct trials. NIRS data replicated the fMRI results. Thus, increased frontal activity was correlated with the accuracy of WM in both healthy control and schizophrenic participants. The major difference between the two groups concerned functional asymmetry; healthy subjects recruited right frontal regions during spatial WM maintenance whereas schizophrenic subjects recruited a wider network in both hemispheres to achieve the same level of memory performance. Increased \"false memory\" errors and accompanying bilateral prefrontal activation in schizophrenia suggest that the etiology of memory errors must be considered when comparing group performances. Finally, the concordance of fMRI and NIRS data supports NIRS as an alternative functional neuroimaging method for psychiatric research.",

      "title": "Effect of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation on frontostriatal working memory activation in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits contribute strongly to disability in schizophrenia, and are resistant to existing medications. Recent drug development has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80\u2009mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable patients with schizophrenia (n\u2009=\u200926 analyzed). We focused on 3\u2009T fMRI response in frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and anterior cingulate/paracingulate (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative symptom scores (r\u2009=\u2009-0.42, p\u2009=\u20090.031), and exploratory correlations suggested broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism, which may benefit an important subset of individuals with schizophrenia. Imaging biomarkers may reveal therapeutic mechanisms, and help guide treatment toward specific populations.",

No exclusion criteria (animal study, review, non-fMRI modality, or lack of comparator) apply.
