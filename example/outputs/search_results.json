      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) impairments are common features of psychiatric disorders. A systematic meta-analysis was performed to determine common and disorder-specific brain fMRI response during performance of WM tasks in patients with SZ and patients with MDD relative to healthy controls (HC). Thirty-four published fMRI studies of WM in patients with SZ and 18 published fMRI studies of WM in patients with MDD, including relevant HC, were included in the meta-analysis. In both SZ and MDD there was common stronger fMRI response in right medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which are part of the default mode network (DMN). The effects were of greater magnitude in SZ than MDD, especially in prefrontal-temporal-cingulate-striatal-cerebellar regions. In addition, a disorder-specific weaker fMRI response was observed in right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in MDD, relative to HC. For both SZ and MDD a significant correlation was observed between the severity of clinical symptoms and lateralized fMRI response relative to HC. These findings indicate that there may be common and distinct anomalies in brain function underlying deficits in WM in SZ and MDD, which may serve as a potential functional neuroimaging-based diagnostic biomarker with value in supporting clinical diagnosis, measuring illness severity and assessing the efficacy of treatments for SZ and MDD at the brain level.",

      "abstract": "Episodic memory deficits are consistently documented as a core aspect of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients, present from the onset of the illness and strongly associated with functional disability. Over the past decade, research using approaches from experimental cognitive neuroscience revealed disproportionate episodic memory impairments in schizophrenia (Sz) under high cognitive demand relational encoding conditions and relatively unimpaired performance under item-specific encoding conditions. These specific deficits in component processes of episodic memory reflect impaired activation and connectivity within specific elements of frontal-medial temporal lobe circuits, with a central role for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), relatively intact function of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and variable results in the hippocampus. We propose that memory deficits can be understood within the broader context of cognitive deficits in Sz, where impaired DLPFC-related cognitive control has a broad impact across multiple cognitive domains. The therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Evidence suggests functional brain networks, especially the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN), to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Dysfunctions within the locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenaline (NE) system, which is supposed to be pivotal to modulate neuronal network activation during executive control (e.g., working memory function), are also considered to play a vital role in the occurrence of positive (e.g., hallucinatory) or negative (e.g., inattentive) symptoms in these patients. In the present study, we sought to shed further light on the role of the LC-NE system in patients with schizophrenia. More specifically, we wanted to improve our understanding of the relationship and possible disturbances of the ECN and DMN during a working memory task in patients. A total of 58 healthy control subjects and 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia were investigated using a working memory 3-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Main findings of our present study were differential dynamics of ECN and DMN blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activations with increasing task demands in both patients and controls. Moreover, we found increased BOLD activation in the LC in patients compared to controls in the interaction contrast between groups and conditions. LC BOLD activation significantly correlated with both, the main hub of the ECN, that is, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and of the DMN, that is, the posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, the LC-NE system seems to be crucial in modulating neuronal network activity in a 3-back working memory task and might significantly contribute to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Combining fMRI and DISC1 gene haplotypes to understand working memory-related brain activity in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "The DISC1 gene\u00a0is one of the most relevant susceptibility genes for psychosis. However, the complex genetic landscape of this locus, which includes protective and risk variants in interaction, may have hindered consistent conclusions on how DISC1 contributes to schizophrenia (SZ) liability. Analysis from haplotype approaches and brain-based phenotypes can contribute to understanding DISC1 role in the neurobiology of this\u00a0disorder. We assessed the brain correlates of DISC1 haplotypes associated with SZ through a functional neuroimaging genetics approach. First, we tested the association of two DISC1 haplotypes, the HEP1 (rs6675281-1000731-rs999710) and the HEP3 (rs151229-rs3738401), with the risk for SZ in a sample of 138 healthy subjects (HS) and 238 patients. This approach allowed the identification of three haplotypes associated with SZ (HEP1-CTG, HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA). Second, we explored whether these haplotypes exerted differential effects on n-back associated brain activity in a subsample of 70 HS compared to 70 patients (diagnosis\u2009\u00d7\u2009haplotype interaction effect). These analyses evidenced that HEP3-GA and HEP3-AA modulated working memory functional response conditional to the health/disease status in the cuneus, precuneus, middle cingulate cortex and the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Our results are the first to show a diagnosis-based effect of DISC1 haplotypes on working memory-related brain activity, emphasising its role in SZ.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test whether bilinear and nonlinear effective connectivity (EC) measures of working memory fMRI data can differentiate between patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC). We applied bilinear and nonlinear Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for the analysis of verbal working memory in 16 SZ and 21 HC. The connection strengths with nonlinear modulation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN) were evaluated. We used Bayesian Model Selection at the group and family levels to compare the optimal bilinear and nonlinear models. Bayesian Model Averaging was used to assess the connection strengths with nonlinear modulation. The DCM analyses revealed that SZ and HC used different bilinear networks despite comparable behavioral performance. In addition, the connection strengths with nonlinear modulation between the DLPFC and the VTA/SN area showed differences between SZ and HC. The adoption of different functional networks in SZ and HC indicated neurobiological alterations underlying working memory performance, including different connection strengths with nonlinear modulation between the DLPFC and the VTA/SN area. These novel findings may increase our understanding of connectivity in working memory in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide switching between activity states using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "A relationship between working memory impairment, disordered neuronal oscillations, and abnormal prefrontal GABA function has been hypothesized in schizophrenia; however, in vivo GABA measurements and gamma band neural synchrony have not yet been compared in schizophrenia. This case-control pilot study (N\u00a0=\u00a024) compared baseline and working memory task-induced neuronal oscillations acquired with high-density electroencephalograms (EEGs) to GABA levels measured in vivo with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Working memory performance, baseline GABA level in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and measures of gamma oscillations from EEGs at baseline and during a working memory task were obtained.\u00a0A major limitation of this study is a relatively small sample size for several analyses due to the integration of diverse methodologies and participant compliance. Working memory performance was significantly lower for patients than for controls. During the working memory task, patients (n\u00a0=\u00a07) had significantly lower amplitudes in gamma oscillations than controls (n\u00a0=\u00a09). However, both at rest and across working memory stages, there were significant correlations between gamma oscillation amplitude and left DLPFC GABA level. Peak gamma frequency during the encoding stage of the working memory task (n\u00a0=\u00a016) significantly correlated with GABA level and working memory performance. Despite gamma band amplitude deficits in patients across working memory stages, both baseline and working memory-induced gamma oscillations showed strong dependence on baseline GABA levels in patients and controls. These findings suggest a critical role for GABA function in gamma band oscillations, even under conditions of system and cognitive impairments as seen in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is impaired in psychotic disorders and linked to functional outcome. Most neurobiological models emphasize prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction in the etiology of WM impairment. However, WM is composed of multiple processes, including encoding and maintenance, and the delineation of the neurobiology of these sub-processes has not been well characterized in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Functional MRI was obtained during an event-related spatial delayed match-to-sample task from 58 healthy individuals, 72 individuals with schizophrenia and 41 people with bipolar I disorder with psychotic features in order to: 1) characterize neural responses during encoding, maintenance and retrieval stages of WM using complementary region-of-interest and whole brain approaches; 2) determine whether schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder exhibit similar abnormalities in WM-related brain function; and 3) elucidate the associations between WM-related brain function, task performance, and neuropsychological functioning. Both schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder groups showed encoding- and maintenance-related impairments in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and frontal eye fields (FEF). BOLD response in the PPC and FEF, during encoding and maintenance respectively, was associated with task performance independent of group. Additionally, encoding-related activation in the PPC correlated with general neuropsychological functioning independent of group. Only encoding-related activation in the right ventral striatum differed between schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder; individuals with schizophrenia showed significantly lower activation than both psychotic bipolar disorder and healthy groups. Our results are consistent with emerging evidence implicating PPC dysfunction in WM impairment and suggest interventions targeting neural activation in PPC may improve WM and neuropsychological functioning across psychotic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Although people with schizophrenia (PSZ) exhibit robust and reliable deficits in working memory (WM) capacity, the neural processes that give rise to this impairment remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment has been associated with poor real-world functioning in patients with Schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that pharmacological treatment with anticholinergic properties may contribute to cognitive impairment in Schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of the anticholinergic burden (ACB) on brain activity, cognition, and real-world functioning in Schizophrenia. We hypothesized that greater ACB would be associated with altered brain activity along with poorer cognitive performance and lower real-world functioning. A sample of 100 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was recruited in the naturalistic multicenter study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses (NIRP) across 7 centres. For each participant, ACB was evaluated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale. The association of ACB with brain function was assessed using BOLD fMRI during the N-Back Working Memory (WM) task in a nested cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a031). Real-world functioning was assessed using the Specific Level of Functioning (SLOF) scale. Patients with high ACB scores (\u22653) showed lower brain activity in the WM frontoparietal network (TFCE corrected alpha <0.05) and poorer cognitive performance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) than patients with low ACB scores (<3). Both effects were unaffected by demographic characteristics, clinical severity, and antipsychotic dosage. Moreover, patients with high ACB showed poorer real-world functioning than patients with lower ACB (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Our results suggest that ACB in Schizophrenia is associated with impaired WM and abnormal underlying brain function along with reduced real-world functioning. Clinical practice should consider the potential adverse cognitive effects of ACB in the treatment decision-making process.",

      "abstract": "Impaired working memory (WM) is a core neuropsychological dysfunction of schizophrenia, however complex interactions among the information storage, information processing and attentional aspects of WM tasks make it difficult to uncover the psychophysiological mechanisms of this deficit. Thirty-six first-episode and drug-na\u00efve schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Here, we modified a WM task to isolate components of WM storage and WM processing, while also varying the difficulty level (load) of the task to study regional differences in load-specific activation using mixed effects models, and its relationship to distributed gene expression. Comparing patients with HCs, we found both attentional deficits and WM deficits, with WM processing being more impaired than WM storage in patients. In patients, but not controls, a linear modulation of brain activation was observed mainly in the frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. In controls, an inverted U-shaped response pattern was identified in the left anterior cingulate cortex. The vertex of this inverted U-shape was lower in patients than controls, and a left-shifting axis of symmetry was associated with better WM performance in patients. Both the above linear and U-shaped modulation effects were associated with the expressions of the genes enriched in the dopamine neurotransmitter system across all cortical brain regions. These findings indicate that a WM processing deficit is evident in schizophrenia from an early stage before antipsychotic treatment, and associated with a dopamine pathway related aberration in nonlinear response pattern at the cingulate cortex when processing WM load.",

      "title": "Effects of neuroactive metabolites of the tryptophan pathway on working memory and cortical thickness in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "A number of tryptophan metabolites known to be neuroactive have been examined for their potential associations with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Among these metabolites, kynurenic acid (KYNA), 5-hydroxyindole (5-HI), and quinolinic acid (QUIN) are documented in their diverse effects on \u03b1-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) and/or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), two of the receptor types thought to contribute to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. In this study, serum levels of KYNA, 5-HI, and QUIN were measured in 195 patients with schizophrenia and in 70 healthy controls using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; cognitive performance in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and cortical thickness measured by magnetic resonance imaging were obtained. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower serum KYNA (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and QUIN (p\u2009=\u20090.02) levels, and increased 5-HI/KYNA (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and QUIN/KYNA ratios (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with healthy controls. Multiple linear regression showed that working memory was positively correlated with serum 5-HI levels (t\u2009=\u20092.10, p\u2009=\u20090.04), but inversely correlated with KYNA concentrations (t\u2009=\u2009-2.01, p\u2009=\u20090.05) in patients. Patients with high 5-HI and low KYNA had better working memory than other subgroups (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Higher 5-HI levels were associated with thicker left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (t\u2009=\u20093.71, p\u2009=\u20092.94\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

      "abstract": "Central nervous system diseases are not currently diagnosed based on knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying their symptoms. Greater understanding may be offered through an agnostic approach to traditional disease categories, where learning more about shared biological mechanisms across conditions could potentially reclassify sub-groups of patients to allow realisation of more effective treatments. This review represents the output of the collaborative group \"PRISM\", tasked with considering assay choices for assessment of attention and working memory in a transdiagnostic cohort of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia patients exhibiting symptomatic spectra of social withdrawal. A multidimensional analysis of this nature has not been previously attempted. Nominated assays (continuous performance test III, attention network test, digit symbol substitution, N-back, complex span, spatial navigation in a virtual environment) reflected a necessary compromise between the need for broad assessment of the neuropsychological constructs in question with several pragmatic criteria: patient burden, compatibility with neurophysiologic measures and availability of preclinical homologues.",

This study aims at corroborating the differences in the brain activities involved in the process of working memory between patients with schizophrenia and the controls. Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 11 controls participated in the study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess cortical activities during the performance of a two-back verbal working memory paradigm using the Korean alphabet as mnemonic content. Group analysis revealed that inferior fontal, middle frontal, and superior temporal region showed decreased cortical activities in the patient group compared to those of the controls. This study showed a decreased activation in inferior fontal (BA 47), middle frontal (BA 6), and superior temporal (BA 22/38) neural networks from the patient group and confirmed the earlier findings on the impaired working memory of schizophrenic patients in the fMRI investigation.",

ALE analysis of studies in healthy individuals indicates a widespread distribution of activation changes with WM training in the frontal and parietal regions, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the precuneus, as well as subcortical regions such as the insula and the striatum. WM training is also accompanied by activation changes in patients with schizophrenia, mainly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus and the fusiform gyrus. Our results demonstrate that WM training is accompanied by changes in neural activation patterns in healthy individuals, which may provide the basis for understanding neuroplastic changes in patients with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Studies in nonhuman primates documented that appropriate stimulation of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is critical for working memory processing. The defective ability of patients with schizophrenia at working memory tasks is a core feature of this illness. It has been postulated that this impairment relates to a deficiency in mesocortical DA function. In this study, D1 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography and the selective D1 receptor antagonist [11C]NNC 112 in 16 patients with schizophrenia (seven drug-naive and nine drug-free patients) and 16 matched healthy controls. [11C]NNC 112 binding potential (BP) was significantly elevated in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia (1.63 +/- 0.39 ml/gm) compared with control subjects (1.27 +/- 0.44 ml/gm; p = 0.02). In patients with schizophrenia, increased DLPFC [11C]NNC 112 BP was a strong predictor of poor performance at the n-back task, a test of working memory. These findings confirm that alteration of DLPFC D1 receptor transmission is involved in working memory deficits presented by patients with schizophrenia. Increased D1 receptor availability observed in patients with schizophrenia might represent a compensatory (but ineffective) upregulation secondary to sustained deficiency in mesocortical DA function.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia, as a chronic and persistent disorder, exhibits working memory deficits across various stages of the disorder, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits remain elusive with inconsistent neuroimaging findings. We aimed to compare the brain functional changes of working memory in patients at different stages: clinical high risk, first-episode psychosis, and long-term schizophrenia, using meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Following a systematic literature search, 56 whole-brain task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (15 for clinical high risk, 16 for first-episode psychosis, and 25 for long-term schizophrenia) were included. The separate and pooled neurofunctional mechanisms among clinical high risk, first-episode psychosis, and long-term schizophrenia were generated by Seed-based d Mapping toolbox. The clinical high risk and first-episode psychosis groups exhibited overlapping hypoactivation in the right inferior parietal lobule, right middle frontal gyrus, and left superior parietal lobule, indicating key lesion sites in the early phase of schizophrenia. Individuals with first-episode psychosis showed lower activation in left inferior parietal lobule than those with long-term schizophrenia, reflecting a possible recovery process or more neural inefficiency. We concluded that SCZ represent as a continuum in the early stage of illness progression, while the neural bases are inversely changed with the development of illness course to long-term course.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral evidence indicates that working memory (WM) in schizophrenia is already impaired at the encoding stage. However, the neurophysiological basis of this primary deficit remains poorly understood. Using event-related fMRI, we assessed differences in brain activation and functional connectivity during the encoding, maintenance and retrieval stages of a visual WM task with 3 levels of memory load in 17 adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 matched controls. The amount of information patients could store in WM was reduced at all memory load levels. During encoding, activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and extrastriate visual cortex, which in controls positively correlated with the amount of stored information, was reduced in patients. Additionally, patients showed disturbed functional connectivity between prefrontal and visual areas. During retrieval, right inferior VLPFC hyperactivation was correlated with hypoactivation of left VLPFC in patients during encoding. Visual WM encoding is disturbed by a failure to adequately engage a visual-prefrontal network critical for the transfer of perceptual information into WM. Prefrontal hyperactivation appears to be a secondary consequence of this primary deficit. Isolating the component processes of WM can lead to more specific neurophysiological markers for translational efforts seeking to improve the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) impairment, a core feature of schizophrenia, is often associated with aberrant dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activation. Reduced resting-state connectivity within the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) has also been reported in schizophrenia. However, interpretation of WM-related dlPFC dysfunction has been limited by performance differences between patients and controls, and by uncertainty over the relevance of resting-state connectivity to network engagement during task. We contrasted brain activation in 40 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls during verbal WM performance, and evaluated underlying functional connectivity during rest and task. During correct trials, patients demonstrated normal FPCN activation, despite an inverse relationship between positive symptoms and activation. FPCN activation differed between the groups only during error trials (controls>patients). In contrast, controls demonstrated stronger deactivation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during correct and error trials. Functional connectivity analysis indicated impaired resting-state FPCN connectivity in patients, but normal connectivity during task. However, patients showed abnormal connectivity among regions such as vmPFC, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) during both rest and task. During task, patients also exhibited altered thalamic connectivity to PHG and FPCN. Activation and connectivity patterns that were more characteristic of controls generally correlated with better performance. In summary, patients demonstrated normal FPCN activation when they remained on-task, and exhibited normal FPCN connectivity during WM, whereas vmPFC deactivation differences persisted regardless of WM performance. Our findings suggest that altered FPCN activation in patients reflects performance difference, and that limbic and thalamic dysfunction is critically involved in WM deficits in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Considerable individual differences in learning ability have long been recognized, yet cognitive learning studies traditionally emphasized group averages while overlooking individual differences. We conducted intersubject similarity of functional connectivity analysis on a month-long randomized controlled trial dataset. Subjects in the training group, together with an additional 66 subjects undergoing the same training, were included to examine the correlations between intersubject similarity of functional connectivity and the intersubject similarity of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to mental disorders (schizophrenia, attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder). We also used the Allen Human Brain Atlas to investigate genetic correlations at the gene expression level. Training increased the intersubject similarity of functional connectivity of some brain networks (especially the limbic network-frontoparietal network) across the resting and task states. Furthermore, the change in the intersubject similarity of functional connectivity of the limbic network-frontoparietal network after training seems to have a different genetic basis from its intersubject similarity of functional connectivity at baseline. Allen Human Brain Atlas analysis on the limbic network-frontoparietal network indicated correlations at baseline functional connectivity weights functional connectivity. Working memory training resulted in specific brain changes that differed among individuals, which may be partially due to genetics, especially concerning single nucleotide polymorphisms related to schizophrenia. Our findings emphasize the need to consider individual genetic backgrounds in personalized cognitive training.",

WM-models serve as theoretical and empirical framework for the investigation of cognitive dysfunction as well as of schizophrenic phenomenology. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging data support the concept of a supramodal WM-deficit in schizophrenia, associated with the functional integrity of prefrontal regions. This review provides a short overview of WM-dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as its impact on psychopathology. Furthermore, the relationship of WM-associated cerebral activation and psychopathological symptoms is illustrated. Currently available studies on WM-function and psychopathology in schizophrenia obtained rather heterogeneous results, although disorganisation and negative symptoms may be closely linked to prefrontal regions. The investigation of WM-function in schizophrenic subsyndromes with functional neuroimaging techniques still remains a clinical and scientific desideratum.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is associated with working memory (WM) impairments; however, the relationship between cannabis use and WM neural circuitry is unclear. We examined whether a cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with differences in brain morphology between control subjects with and without a CUD and between schizophrenia subjects with and without a CUD, and whether these differences related to WM and CUD history. Subjects group-matched on demographics included 44 healthy controls, 10 subjects with a CUD history, 28 schizophrenia subjects with no history of substance use disorders, and 15 schizophrenia subjects with a CUD history. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping with magnetic resonance imaging was used to obtain surface-based representations of the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, compared across groups, and correlated with WM and CUD history. Surface maps were generated to visualize morphological differences. There were significant cannabis-related parametric decreases in WM across groups. Similar cannabis-related shape differences were observed in the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus in controls and schizophrenia subjects. Cannabis-related striatal and thalamic shape differences correlated with poorer WM and younger age of CUD onset in both groups. Schizophrenia subjects demonstrated cannabis-related neuroanatomical differences that were consistent and exaggerated compared with cannabis-related differences found in controls. The cross-sectional results suggest that both CUD groups were characterized by WM deficits and subcortical neuroanatomical differences. Future longitudinal studies could help determine whether cannabis use contributes to these observed shape differences or whether they are biomarkers of a vulnerability to the effects of cannabis that predate its misuse.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal prefrontal functioning plays a central role in the working memory (WM) deficits of schizophrenic patients, but the nature of the relationship between WM and prefrontal activation remains undetermined. Using two functional neuroimaging methods, we investigated the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting in schizophrenic and healthy participants. We focused on the brain activation during WM maintenance phase with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also examined oxygenated hemoglobin changes in relation to memory performance with the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using the same spatial WM task. Distinct types of correct and error trials were segregated for analysis. fMRI data indicated that prefrontal activation was increased during WM maintenance on correct trials in both schizophrenic and healthy subjects. However, a significant difference was observed in the functional asymmetry of frontal activation pattern. Healthy subjects showed increased activation in the right frontal, temporal and cingulate regions. Schizophrenic patients showed greater activation compared with control subjects in left frontal, temporal and parietal regions as well as in right frontal regions. We also observed increased 'false memory' errors in schizophrenic patients, associated with increased prefrontal activation and resembling the activation pattern observed on the correct trials. NIRS data replicated the fMRI results. Thus, increased frontal activity was correlated with the accuracy of WM in both healthy control and schizophrenic participants. The major difference between the two groups concerned functional asymmetry; healthy subjects recruited right frontal regions during spatial WM maintenance whereas schizophrenic subjects recruited a wider network in both hemispheres to achieve the same level of memory performance. Increased \"false memory\" errors and accompanying bilateral prefrontal activation in schizophrenia suggest that the etiology of memory errors must be considered when comparing group performances. Finally, the concordance of fMRI and NIRS data supports NIRS as an alternative functional neuroimaging method for psychiatric research.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a disorder with a high heritability. Patients as well as their first degree relatives display lower levels of performance in a number of cognitive domains compared to subjects without genetic risk. Several studies could link these aberrations to single genetic variants, however, only recently, polygenic risk scores as proxies for genetic risk have been associated with cognitive domains and their neural correlates. In the present study, a sample of healthy subjects (n=137) performed a letter version of the n-back task while scanned with 3-T fMRI. All subjects were genotyped with the PsychChip and polygenic risk scores were calculated based on the PGC2 schizophrenia GWAS results. Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with a lower degree of brain activation in prefrontal areas during the 3-back compared to the 0-back baseline condition. Furthermore, polygenic risk was associated with lower levels of brain activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus during the 3-back compared to a 2-back condition. Polygenic risk leads to a shift in the underlying activation pattern to the left side, thus resembling results reported in patients with schizophrenia. The data may point to polygenic risk for schizophrenia being associated with brain function in a cognitive task known to be impaired in patients and their relatives.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity between brain networks may adapt flexibly to cognitive demand, a process that could underlie adaptive behaviors and cognitive deficits, such as those observed in neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. Dopamine signaling is critical for working memory but its influence on internetwork connectivity is relatively unknown. We addressed these questions in healthy humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (during ann-back working-memory task) and positron emission tomography using the radiotracer [(11)C]FLB457 before and after amphetamine to measure the capacity for dopamine release in extrastriatal brain regions. Brain networks were defined by spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and working-memory-load-dependent connectivity between task-relevant pairs of networks was determined via a modified psychophysiological interaction analysis. For most pairs of task-relevant networks, connectivity significantly changed as a function of working-memory load. Moreover, load-dependent changes in connectivity between left and right frontoparietal networks (\u0394 connectivity lFPN-rFPN) predicted interindividual differences in task performance more accurately than other fMRI and PET imaging measures. \u0394 Connectivity lFPN-rFPN was not related to cortical dopamine release capacity. A second study in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia showed no abnormalities in load-dependent connectivity but showed a weaker relationship between \u0394 connectivity lFPN-rFPN and working memory performance in patients compared with matched healthy individuals. Poor working memory performance in patients was, in contrast, related to deficient cortical dopamine release. Our findings indicate that interactions between brain networks dynamically adapt to fluctuating environmental demands. These dynamic adaptations underlie successful working memory performance in healthy individuals and are not well predicted by amphetamine-induced dopamine release capacity.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficit is an important component of impaired cognition in schizophrenia. However, between-studies inconsistencies as to the specific functional substrate imply that inter-individual variability (IIV) in the WM performance is associated with IIV in brain activity in schizophrenia. To examine the neural substrate of this WM IIV, we studied whether the neural mechanisms that underlie individual differences in WM capacity are the same in schizophrenia patients and healthy people. We correlated the IIV of the task-evoked brain activity and task performance during an n-back WM task with the IIV of the moment-to-moment variability in intrinsic resting-state activity, as measured by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and further compared this relationship between 17 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and 18 healthy controls. Between-group comparisons of the correlation patterns indicated aberrant ALFF-WM activation correlations and ALFF-WM performance correlations in the FES patients, but no significant changes were detected in any single measurement of these three characteristics. Specifically, we found increased positive ALFF-WM activation correlations in the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal cortices and fusiform gyri in the FES patients. We also observed significant increases in positive ALFF-WM performance correlations in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortices in the FES patients. This hyper-coupling between the ALFF and fMRI measures during a WM task may indicate that it was difficult for the patients to detach themselves from one state to transition to another and suggests that the inefficient cortical function in schizophrenia stems from the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain.",

      "title": "Reduced prefrontal-parietal effective connectivity and working memory deficits in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "The neural mechanisms behind cognitive deficits in schizophrenia still remain unclear. Functional neuroimaging studies on working memory (WM) yielded inconsistent results, suggesting task performance as a moderating variable of prefrontal activation. Beyond regional specific activation, disordered integration of brain regions was supposed as a critical pathophysiological mechanism of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Here, we first hypothesized that prefrontal activation implicated in WM depends primarily on task performance and therefore stratified participants into performance subgroups. Second, in line with the dysconnectivity hypothesis, we asked whether connectivity in the prefrontal-parietal network underlying WM is altered in all patients. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human subjects (41 schizophrenia patients, 42 healthy controls) and dynamic causal modeling to examine effective connectivity during a WM task. In line with our first hypothesis, we found that prefrontal activation was differentially modulated by task performance: there was a significant task by group by performance interaction revealing an increase of activation with performance in patients and a decrease with performance in controls. Beyond that, we show for the first time that WM-dependent effective connectivity from prefrontal to parietal cortex is reduced in all schizophrenia patients. This finding was independent of performance. In conclusion, our results are in line with the highly influential hypothesis that the relationship between WM performance and prefrontal activation follows an inverted U-shaped function. Moreover, this study in a large sample of patients reveals a mechanism underlying prefrontal inefficiency and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, thereby providing direct experimental evidence for the dysconnectivity hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Working memory ability matures through puberty and early adulthood. Deficits in working memory are linked to the risk of onset of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, and there is a significant temporal overlap between the peak of first episode psychosis risk and working memory maturation. In order to characterize the normal working memory functional maturation process through this critical phase of cognitive development we conducted a systematic review and coordinate based meta-analyses of all the available primary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0382) that mapped WM function in healthy adolescents (10-17 years) and young adults (18-30 years). Activation Likelihood Estimation analyses across all WM tasks revealed increased activation with increasing subject age in the middle frontal gyrus (BA6) bilaterally, the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the left precuneus and left inferior parietal gyri (BA7; 40). Decreased activation with increasing age was found in the right superior frontal (BA8), left junction of postcentral and inferior parietal (BA3/40), and left limbic cingulate gyrus (BA31). These results suggest that brain activation during adolescence increased with age principally in higher order cortices, part of the core working memory network, while reductions were detected in more diffuse and potentially more immature neural networks. Understanding the process by which the brain and its cognitive functions mature through healthy adulthood may provide us with new clues to understanding the vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficits are key features of schizophrenia and are associated with significant functional impairment. The precise mechanisms of WM and their relationship between WM deficits with other clinical symptoms of schizophrenia remain unclear. Contemporary models propose that WM requires synchronous activity across brain regions within a distributed network, including lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and task-relevant posterior sensory cortical regions. This suggests that WM deficits in patients may be due to PFC functional connectivity (FC) impairments rather than activation impairments per se. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of FC between lateral PFC and visual cortex and univariate activations within these regions during visual WM. We found decreased FC in patients compared to healthy subjects in the context of similar levels of univariate activity. Furthermore, this decreased FC was associated with task performance and clinical symptomatology in patients. The magnitude of FC, particularly during the delay period, was positively correlated with WM task accuracy, while FC during cue was inversely correlated with severity of disorganization. Taken together, these results suggest that impairment in lateral PFC FC is a key aspect of information processing impairment in patients with schizophrenia, and may be a sensitive index of altered neurophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is one of the most impaired cognitive processes in schizophrenia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in this area have typically found a reduction in information processing efficiency but have focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the current study using the Sternberg Item Recognition Test, we consider networks of regions supporting WM and measure the activation of functionally connected neural networks over different WM load conditions. We used constrained principal component analysis with a finite impulse response basis set to compare the estimated hemodynamic response associated with different WM load condition for 15 healthy control subjects and 15 schizophrenia patients. Three components emerged, reflecting activated (task-positive) and deactivated (task-negative or default-mode) neural networks. Two of the components (with both task-positive and task-negative aspects) were load dependent, were involved in encoding and delay phases (one exclusively encoding and the other both encoding and delay), and both showed evidence for decreased efficiency in patients. The results suggest that WM capacity is reached sooner for schizophrenia patients as the overt levels of WM load increase, to the point that further increases in overt memory load do not increase fMRI activation, and lead to performance impairments. These results are consistent with an account holding that patients show reduced efficiency in task-positive and task-negative networks during WM and also partially support the shifted inverted-U-shaped curve theory of the relationship between WM load and fMRI activation in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficits are considered a core cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. To determine cognitive abnormalities in chronic interictal psychosis (CIP), and to assess whether these abnormalities are distinguishable from those seen in schizophrenia in terms of WM deficits, we used magnetoencephalography during a WM task performed by patients with CIP, nonpsychotic epilepsy, and schizophrenia and by healthy subjects. Multiple Source Beamformer and Brain-Voyager were used for analysis. In both patients with CIP and those with schizophrenia, we found dorsolateral prefrontal hyperactivation and left inferior temporal hypoactivation, as indicated by alpha event-related desynchronization and synchronization, respectively. Patients with schizophrenia also showed alpha2 event-related desynchronization in the mid-prefrontal cortex relative to healthy controls. Direct comparison of patients with CIP and schizophrenia rendered no difference in source-power changes. Our findings indicate similar functional cognitive abnormalities in CIP and schizophrenia in the prefrontal and left temporal cortex, which supports the possibility that these disorders share common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The specific contribution of risk or candidate gene variants to the complex phenotype of schizophrenia is largely unknown. Studying the effects of such variants on brain function can provide insight into disease-associated mechanisms on a neural systems level. Previous studies found common variants in the complexin2 (CPLX2) gene to be highly associated with cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients. Similarly, cognitive functioning was found to be impaired in Cplx2 gene-deficient mice if they were subjected to maternal deprivation or mild brain trauma during puberty. Here, we aimed to study seven common CPLX2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their neurogenetic risk mechanisms by investigating their relationship to a schizophrenia-related functional neuroimaging intermediate phenotype. We examined functional MRI and genotype data collected from 104 patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia and 122 healthy controls who participated in the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium study of schizophrenia. Seven SNPs distributed over the whole CPLX2 gene were tested for association with working memory-elicited neural activity in a frontoparietal neural network. Three CPLX2 SNPs were significantly associated with increased neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus in the schizophrenia sample, but showed no association in healthy controls. Since increased working memory-related neural activity in individuals with or at risk for schizophrenia has been interpreted as 'neural inefficiency,' these findings suggest that certain variants of CPLX2 may contribute to impaired brain function in schizophrenia, possibly combined with other deleterious genetic variants, adverse environmental events, or developmental insults.",

      "title": "Prefrontal cortex dysfunction during working memory performance in schizophrenia: reconciling discrepant findings.",
      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficits are a persistent, disabling and relatively treatment-resistant feature of schizophrenia that may underlie many cognitive deficits and symptoms. They are associated with prefrontal cortex dysfunction. While most neuroimaging studies of WM demonstrate \"task-related hypofrontality\" in schizophrenic relative to healthy subjects, several recent studies have reported equal or increased prefrontal activity. These findings challenge central assumptions regarding cognitive deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in schizophrenia. The goal of this review is to reconcile these seemingly discrepant findings. Methodological factors addressed include the use of intersubject averaging, WM task parameters and the reliability of the measures. Factors intrinsic to schizophrenia and their relevance to the selection of experimental methods and the interpretation of group data are also discussed. Both hypo- and hyperfrontality are hypothesized to be valid and informative reflections of prefrontal cortex dysfunction in schizophrenia. Due to the heterogeneity and variability of both performance and regional recruitment in schizophrenia, whether individual data is considered, the level and type of WM demands and the composition of the sample with regard to performance deficits all influence study outcome and contribute to discrepancies. Although the prefrontal cortex is consistently implicated in WM deficits, the basis of its dysfunction and its exact contribution remain unclear. Future work might focus on delineating the exact WM processes, domains and components that are deficient. In addition, variability in behavior and activation might best be regarded as intrinsic to schizophrenia and having a neural basis that requires explanation. In combination with other techniques, neuroimaging can identify the neural circuitry responsible for WM deficits and elucidate the contribution of each anatomical component.",

      "abstract": "Cognition has become a target for therapeutic intervention and favoring arousal could be a way to help patients. Working memory is an arousal dependent cognitive function. This study used functional MRI (fMRI) as a surrogate marker of working memory to evaluate the sensitivity of patients' hypoactive regions to arousal in a subpopulation of rehabilitated patients. Are hypoactive regions sensitive to arousal? Does the deficit result from arousal deficit or improper coupling with cognitive activity? Eighteen patients and matched controls were recruited. Participants performed a working memory task during combined electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI measurements. Cortical regions sensitive to arousal were defined as those which were inversely correlated with low EEG frequencies. Overlap between the arousal-sensitive and hypoactive regions was assessed by mutual information. Arousal-cognitive coupling was evaluated by the correlation between the arousal effect and the task effect. In the patient group, most hypoactive voxels were sensitive to arousal and corresponded to the prefronto-parietal network. But patients had no arousal deficit. Although arousal seems to improve cognitive activity in most of the patients' cortical areas, this coupling appears to be specifically disturbed in their hypoactive regions. In conclusion, although increasing arousal may help cognition, it may do so in an unspecific way.",

      "abstract": "Diffuse structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex have been reported in both schizophrenia patients and their nonpsychotic biological relatives. Additionally, working memory difficulties have long been documented in schizophrenia patients and have been associated with the genetic liability for the disorder. The present analysis investigated the relationship between prefrontal regional gray matter volumes and two facets of working memory in schizophrenia using a family study. Structural neuroimaging scans provided measurements of rostral middle, superior, and inferior prefrontal cortical gray matter volumes. Participants also completed a spatial working memory task that measured both short-term maintenance and manipulation of material in memory. Both schizophrenia patients and relatives had reduced superior and inferior frontal gray matter volumes. Schizophrenia patients demonstrated a spatial working memory deficit compared to both controls and relatives, with no greater impairment when required to manipulate material. Smaller prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia patients were associated with worse working memory performance. These relationships were absent in the nonpsychotic relatives and controls. Despite normative behavioral performance, nonpsychotic relatives demonstrated abnormalities in brain structure similar to those found in schizophrenia patients. Manipulation abilities were not more impaired than maintenance in schizophrenia patients. Consistent with other neuroimaging research, our results suggest that direct measures of the underlying biology may be more sensitive to the effects of the genetic liability for schizophrenia than behavioral measures.",

      "title": "Effect of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulation on frontostriatal working memory activation in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits contribute strongly to disability in schizophrenia, and are resistant to existing medications. Recent drug development has targeted enhanced NMDA function by increasing mGluR2/3 signaling. However, the clinical utility of such agents remains uncertain, and markers of brain circuit function are critical for clarifying mechanisms and understanding individual differences in efficacy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over (14 day washout) pilot study evaluating adjunctive use of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator AZD8529 (80\u2009mg daily for 3 days), in chronic stable patients with schizophrenia (n\u2009=\u200926 analyzed). We focused on 3\u2009T fMRI response in frontostriatal regions during an n-back working memory task, testing the hypothesis that AZD8529 produces fMRI changes that correlate with improvement in negative symptoms and cognition. We found that AZD8529 did not produce significant group-average effects on symptoms or cognitive accuracy. However, AZD8529 did increase n-back fMRI activation in striatum (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and anterior cingulate/paracingulate (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Greater drug-versus-placebo effects on caudate activation significantly correlated with greater reductions in PANSS negative symptom scores (r\u2009=\u2009-0.42, p\u2009=\u20090.031), and exploratory correlations suggested broader effects across multiple symptom domains and regions of interest. These findings demonstrate that fMRI responses to mGluR2 positive modulation relate to individual differences in symptom reduction, and could be pursued for future biomarker development. Negative clinical results at the group level should not lead to premature termination of investigation of this mechanism, which may benefit an important subset of individuals with schizophrenia. Imaging biomarkers may reveal therapeutic mechanisms, and help guide treatment toward specific populations.",

Using a comprehensive battery of standardized measures of intelligence, declarative episodic memory, and executive function, we hypothesized that the variance in neuropsychological performance in schizophrenia may reflect at least 2 distinct sources related to failures of (a) the central executive division of working memory and (b) social comprehension. In comparison to age-matched controls, patients with schizophrenia showed not only overall reduced scores on Wechsler intelligence and memory scales and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) of executive function, but they also demonstrated different patterns of performance for each of these tests. Hierarchical regression revealed executive attentional control, measured by Trails B performance speed, and social comprehension, measured by Wechsler IQ Comprehension and Picture Arrangement subtests, each accounted for a unique and specific proportion of variance in test scores for the patient group, even when controlling for general intelligence. Failures in social comprehension and executive attentional control may account for distinct sources of variance in the neuropsychological impairment of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) dysfunction in schizophrenia is characterized by inefficient WM recruitment and reduced capacity, but it is not yet clear how these relate to one another. In controls practice of certain cognitive tasks induces automatization, which is associated with reduced WM recruitment and increased capacity of concurrent task performance. We therefore investigated whether inefficient function and reduced capacity in schizophrenia was associated with a failure in automatization. FMRI data was acquired with a verbal WM task with novel and practiced stimuli in 18 schizophrenia patients and 18 controls. Participants performed a dual-task outside the scanner to test WM capacity. Patients showed intact performance on the WM task, which was paralleled by excessive WM activity. Practice improved performance and reduced WM activity in both groups. The difference in WM activity after practice predicted performance cost in controls but not in patients. In addition, patients showed disproportionately poor dual-task performance compared to controls, especially when processing information that required continuous adjustment in WM. Our findings support the notion of inefficient WM function and reduced capacity in schizophrenia. This was not related to a failure in automatization, but was evident when processing continuously changing information. This suggests that inefficient WM function and reduced capacity may be related to an inability to process information requiring frequent updating.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether intensive computerized cognitive training in schizophrenia could improve working memory performance and increase signal efficiency of associated middle frontal gyri (MFG) circuits in a functionally meaningful manner. Thirty schizophrenia participants and 13 healthy comparison participants underwent fMRI scanning during a letter N-back working memory task. Schizophrenia participants were then randomly assigned to either 80 h (16 weeks) of cognitive training or a computer games control condition. After this intervention, participants completed a second fMRI N-back scanning session. At baseline, during 2-back working memory trials, healthy participants showed the largest and most significant activation in bilateral MFG, which correlated with task performance. Schizophrenia participants showed impaired working memory, hypoactivation in left MFG, and no correlation between bilateral MFG signal and task performance. After training, schizophrenia participants improved their 2-back working memory performance and showed increased activation in left MFG. They also demonstrated a significant association between enhanced task performance and right MFG signal, similar to healthy participants. Both task performance and brain activity in right MFG after training predicted better generalized working memory at 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, task performance and brain activity within bilateral MFG predicted better occupational functioning at 6-month follow-up. No such findings were observed in the computer games control participants. Working memory impairments in schizophrenia and its underlying neural correlates in MFG can be improved by intensive computerized cognitive training; these improvements generalize beyond the trained task and are associated with enduring effects on cognition and functioning 6 months after the intervention.",

      "abstract": "Neurocognitive cognitive deficits including working memory (WM) impairment is a key component of schizophrenia (SCZ). Though a prefrontal cortex (PFC) abnormality is recognised to contribute to WM impairment, the exact nature of its neurobiological basis in SCZ is not well established. Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging low-cost neuroimaging tool to study neuro-hemodynamics. In this background, we examined the hemodynamic activity during a WM task in schizophrenia using fNIRS. fNIRS was acquired during computerised N-back (zero-, one- & two-back) task in 15 SCZ patients and compared with 22 healthy controls. Performance in N-back test were calculated using signal detection theory alongside the mean reaction times. Concentration and latencies of oxy-, deoxy-, and totalhaemoglobin, and oxygen saturation were computed from 8*8 optodes positioned over bilateral PFC. SCZ performed poorly as measured by most of the WM parameters (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Lesser deoxyhemoglobin concentration (two\u202f>\u202fzero, at right BA10, p\u202f=\u202f0.006) was noted in the right frontopolar cortex in SCZ surviving multiple-comparison correction. In addition, olanzapine equivalent doses correlated negatively with right frontopolar cortex activation (two\u202f>\u202fzero back, BA10, \u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.70, p\u202f=\u202f0.004) and better performance in two back (false alarm rate, \u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.61, p\u202f=\u202f0.015). A delayed but compensatory hyperactivation of right frontopolar cortex noted in SCZ may underlie the WM deficit in SCZ. Future studies are recommended to replicate the role of right frontopolar cortex in WM using larger samples and systematically explore the effect of antipsychotics on them.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia and is characterized by abnormal functional integration in the prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). However, the specific mechanism by which the abnormal neuronal circuits that involve these brain regions contribute to this deficit is still unclear. Therefore, this study focused on these regions and sought to answer which abnormal causal relationships in these regions can be linked to impaired WM in schizophrenia. We used spectral dynamic causal modeling to estimate directed (effective) connectivity between these regions based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from healthy control (HC) subjects and patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES). By comparing these effective connections in the controls and patients, we found that the effective connectivity from the dACC to the dLPFC and from the right dLPFC to the left vLPFC was weaker in the FES group than in the HC group. Furthermore, these effective connections displayed a positive correlation with WM performance in the HCs. However, in the FES patients, the effective connectivity from the dACC to the dLPFC was not correlated with WM performance, and the effective connectivity from the right dLPFC to the left vLPFC was negatively correlated with WM performance. These results could be explained by an aberrant top-down mechanism of WM processing and provide new evidence for the dysconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia.",

Research in neurotypical individuals has shown that storage capacity is more closely related to posterior parietal cortex (PPC) than PFC, suggesting that reductions in WM storage capacity in schizophrenia that are associated with broad cognitive deficits may be related to neural activity in PPC. In the present human neuroimaging study, 37 PSZ and 37 matched healthy control subjects of either sex completed a change detection task with varying set sizes while undergoing fMRI.

Since the brain continues to mature into early adulthood, developmental differences in brain structure and function may provide clues to the underlying neurobiology of schizophrenia. With an emerging body of evidence supporting disrupted connectivity contributing to the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it was our goal to assess differences in functional connectivity in children and adolescents who develop schizophrenia. Participants included a total of 28 children and adolescents (14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 age- and gender-matched controls). All subjects underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan involving a modified Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm with 3 working memory (WkM) loads. Patients had poorer performance at all 3 WkM loads without a load by diagnosis interaction. Functional imaging results demonstrated 3 specific brain networks disrupted in children and adolescents with schizophrenia. These networks include 1) the anterior cingulate and the temporal lobes, bilaterally; 2) the cerebellum with subcortical regions; and 3) the occipital lobe and the cerebellum. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal functional connectivity in networks involving limbic, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and early visual processing streams.",

      "abstract": "Impairments in memory functions are among the most robust correlates of schizophrenia and of poor functional outcomes in individuals with psychotic disorders. Prospective, longitudinal studies are crucial to determining the meaning of these deficits in relation to mechanisms associated with the onset and course of these disorders.The objective of this review is to examine the literature concerning premorbid memory impairments during the prodromal phase of psychosis to address three primary questions 1) are memory impairments present among individuals with a clinical high risk syndrome? 2) are memory deficits in clinical high risk cases predictive of future conversion to psychosis? and 3) what are the underlying neural correlates of memory impairment in clinical high risk individuals and are they also predictive of future conversion?PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched. The primary inclusion criteria were to select studies that 1) were original research articles published in a peer-reviewed journal in the past 25\u00a0years, 2) studied subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis or in the prodromal phase of illness, and 3) included examinations into verbal memory performance in those at clinical high risk for psychosis.64 articles were identified and screened for eligibility. The review included 34 studies investigating verbal memory impairment in clinical high risk individuals compared to controls. The average effect size of verbal learning total recall was .58, indicating a moderate level of impairment in verbal learning among individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis as compared to healthy controls. Of studies that predicted time to conversion, indices of memory, particularly declarative and verbal working memory, were especially predictive of future conversion. Finally, when examining investigations of the neural correlates of memory dysfunction in the clinical high risk state, findings suggest altered activation and functional connectivity among medial temporal lobe regions may underlie differences in memory performance between clinical high risk individuals and healthy controls.Findings to date strongly indicate that memory impairments are present during the premorbid phase of psychosis and that verbal memory impairment in particular is predictive of future conversion to psychosis. Evidence from fMRI studies is fairly consistent in showing greater activation of memory-related regions during retrieval among clinical high risk cases who convert, with less consistent evidence of altered functional connectivity in the encoding phase. These findings support the use of verbal learning and memory measures in the psychosis prediction and prevention field.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) deficits are core symptoms of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The psychological concept of WM offers a theoretical and empirical framework for the investigation of perceptual and attentional dysfunction as well as of deficits of higher cognitive functions in schizophrenia. From a theoretical perspective, schizophrenic psychopathology and cognitive dysfunction can be both integrated and experimentally validated within the concept of WM-impairment. In the last years investigation of WM has been a major issue in neuropsychiatric research, not least because of the association of prefrontal cortex and WM-function. The advent of functional imaging techniques, e. g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) has additionally contributed in generating neurobiological WM-models. Regarding the neuronal basis of WM-deficits in schizophrenia, prefrontal cortex dysfunction has been of major interest. This review provides a short overview on the concept of WM and its relevance for cognitive psychology, discussing both recent behavioral and functional neuroimaging evidence on WM-dysfunction in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Many genetic studies report mixed results both for the associations between COMT polymorphisms and schizophrenia and for the effects of COMT variants on common intermediate phenotypes of the disorder. Reasons for this may include small genetic effect sizes and the modulation of environmental influences. To improve our understanding of the role of COMT in the disease etiology, we investigated the effect of DNA methylation in the MB-COMT promoter on neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during working memory processing as measured by fMRI - an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Imaging and epigenetic data were measured in 102 healthy controls and 82 schizophrenia patients of the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) study of schizophrenia. Neural activity during the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm was acquired with either a 3T Siemens Trio or 1.5T Siemens Sonata and analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). DNA methylation measurements were derived from cryo-conserved blood samples. We found a positive association between MB-COMT promoter methylation and neural activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a model using a region-of-interest approach and could confirm this finding in a whole-brain model. This effect was independent of disease status. Analyzing the effect of MB-COMT promoter DNA methylation on a neuroimaging phenotype can provide further evidence for the importance of COMT and epigenetic risk mechanisms in schizophrenia. The latter may represent trans-regulatory or environmental risk factors that can be measured using brain-based intermediate phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Altered connectivity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus during working memory is considered an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia (SCZ), but the relevance for other mental disorders with shared genetic background remains unknown. Here we investigated its presence in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Furthermore, we aimed to provide an independent replication of this phenotype in first-degree relatives of SCZ patients. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 309 healthy controls and 218 healthy first-degree relatives of index patients with SCZ (n = 62), BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90), who completed the n-back working memory paradigm. We observed a significant group effect on DLPFC-hippocampus coupling (PFWE = .031, all P-values region of interest [ROI] corrected). Post hoc comparisons revealed that this effect was driven by the SCZ relatives, who showed a significant increase in the negative functional connectivity of the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls (PFWE = .001), BD relatives (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWE-values > .451). Supplementary analyses suggested that the SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range of potential confounds, including structural differences. Our data further support altered DLPFC-hippocampus connectivity during working memory as an intermediate phenotype for SCZ. This suggests that this phenotype is relatively specific to SCZ and does not translate to other genetically related disorders in the mood-psychosis spectrum.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal fusion is an effective approach to better understand brain disease. To date, most current fusion approaches are unsupervised; there is need for a multivariate method that can adopt prior information to guide multimodal fusion. Here we proposed a novel supervised fusion model, called \"MCCAR+jICA\", which enables both identification of multimodal co-alterations and linking the covarying brain regions with a specific reference signal, e.g., cognitive scores. The proposed method has been validated on both simulated and real human brain data. Features from 3 modalities (fMRI, sMRI, dMRI) obtained from 147 schizophrenia patients and 147 age-matched healthy controls were included as fusion input, who participated in the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) Phase III study. Our aim was to investigate the group co-alterations seen in three types of MRI data that are also correlated with working memory performance. One joint IC was found both significantly group-discriminating (p=7.4E-06, 0.001, 7.0E-09) and highly correlated with working memory scores(r=0.296, 0.241, 0.301) and PANSS negative scores (r=-0.229, -0.276, -0.240) for fMRI, dMRI and sMRI, respectively. Given the simulation and FBIRN results, MCCAR+jICA is shown to be an effective multivariate approach to extract accurate and stable multimodal components associated with a particular measure of interest, and promises a wide application in identifying potential neuromarkers for mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Impaired working memory (WM) function in schizophrenia has been associated with abnormal activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). It is, however, not clear whether abnormal activation is a sign of DLPFC pathology, or a correlate of poor performance. We address this question by examining activity in the WM brain system at different levels of task difficulty. A parametric fMRI paradigm is used to examine how the WM system responds to increasing load. A parametric fMRI design with four levels of a spatial N-back task was used to examine the relationships between working memory load, functional output (performance) and brain activity in 10 schizophrenic patients on atypical antipsychotic medication and to compare these to 10 healthy controls. In spite of increasingly poor performance in schizophrenic patients, activity increased normally in DLPFC and inferior parietal cortex bilaterally and in anterior cingulate, with increasing load. At 3-back, activity dropped in DLPFC in comparison with controls, but not in the other regions. The results indicate that peak activation of the WM-system is reached at a lower processing load in schizophrenic patients than in healthy controls. As a decline of DLPFC activity at high processing loads in itself is not abnormal, WM dysfunction in schizophrenia appears to be the result of an impaired functional output of the whole WM system, causing elevation of the effective burden imposed by WM tasks.",

      "abstract": "Deficits in working memory (WM) are a consistent neurocognitive marker for schizophrenia. Previous studies have suggested that WM is the product of coordinated activity in distributed functionally connected brain regions. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven approach that can identify temporally coherent networks that underlie fMRI activity. We applied ICA to an fMRI dataset for 115 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 130 healthy controls by performing the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm. Here, we describe the first results using ICA to identify differences in the function of WM networks in schizophrenia compared to controls. ICA revealed six networks that showed significant differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Four of these networks were negatively task-correlated and showed deactivation across the posterior cingulate, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobules, and parahippocampus. These networks comprise brain regions known as the default-mode network (DMN), a well-characterized set of regions shown to be active during internal modes of cognition and implicated in schizophrenia. Two networks were positively task-correlated, with one network engaging WM regions such as bilateral DLPFC and inferior parietal lobules while the other network engaged primarily the cerebellum. Our results suggest that DLPFC dysfunction in schizophrenia might be lateralized to the left and intrinsically tied to other regions such as the inferior parietal lobule and cingulate gyrus. Furthermore, we found that DMN dysfunction in schizophrenia exists across multiple subnetworks of the DMN and that these subnetworks are individually relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In summary, this large multisite study identified multiple temporally coherent networks, which are aberrant in schizophrenia versus healthy controls and suggests that both task-correlated and task-anticorrelated networks may serve as potential biomarkers.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable and polygenic disease, and identified common genetic variants have shown weak individual effects. Many studies have reported altered working memory (WM)-related brain activation in schizophrenia, preferentially in the frontal lobe. Such differences in brain activations could reflect inherited alterations possibly involved in the disease etiology, or rather secondary disease-related mechanisms. The use of polygenic risk scores (PGRS) based on a large number of risk polymorphisms with small effects is a valuable approach to examine the effect of cumulative genetic risk on brain functioning. This study examined the impact of cumulative genetic risk for schizophrenia on WM-related brain activations, assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each participant (63 schizophrenia patients and 118 healthy controls), we calculated a PGRS for schizophrenia based on 18 862 single-nucleotide polymorphism in a large multicenter genome-wide association study including 9146 schizophrenia patients and 12 111 controls, performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. As expected, the PGRS was significantly higher in patients compared with healthy controls. Further, the PGRS was related to differences in frontal lobe brain activation between high and low WM demand. Specifically, even in absence of main effects of diagnosis, increased PGRS was associated with decreased activation difference in the right middle-superior prefrontal cortex (BA 10/11) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45). This effect was seen in both cases and controls, and was not influenced by sex, age, or task performance. The findings support the notion of dysregulation of frontal lobe functioning as an inherited vulnerability factor in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Previous meta-analyses found abnormal brain activations in schizophrenia patients compared with normal controls when performing working memory tasks. Although most studies focused on dysfunction of the working memory activation network in schizophrenia patients, deactivation abnormalities of the working memory in the default mode network have also been reported in schizophrenia but have received less attention. Our goal was to discover whether deactivation abnormalities can also be consistently found in schizophrenia during working memory tasks and, further, to consider both activation and deactivation abnormalities. Fifty-two English language peer-reviewed studies were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with normal controls, the schizophrenia patients showed activation dysfunction of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex as well as the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor area, which are core nodes of the central executive and salience network. In addition to dysfunction of the activation networks, the patients showed deactivation abnormalities in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, which are core nodes of the default mode network. These results suggest that both activation and deactivation abnormalities exist in schizophrenia patients and that these abnormalities should both be considered when investigating the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Abnormal prefrontal and parietal activity linked to deficient active binding in working memory in schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Working memory deficits have been widely reported in schizophrenia, and may result from inefficient binding processes. These processes, and their neural correlates, remain understudied in schizophrenia. Thus, we designed an FMRI study aimed at investigating the neural correlates of both passive and active binding in working memory in schizophrenia. Nineteen patients with schizophrenia and 23 matched controls were recruited to perform a working memory binding task, in which they were instructed to memorize three letters and three spatial locations. In the passive binding condition, letters and spatial locations were directly presented as bound. Conversely, in the active binding condition, words and spatial locations were presented as separated, and participants were instructed to intentionally create associations between them. Patients exhibited a similar performance to the controls for the passive binding condition, but a significantly lower performance for the active binding. FMRI analyses revealed that this active binding deficit was related to aberrant activity in the posterior parietal cortex and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This study provides initial evidence of a specific deficit for actively binding information in schizophrenia, which is linked to dysfunctions in the neural networks underlying attention, manipulation of information, and encoding strategies. Together, our results suggest that all these dysfunctions may be targets for neuromodulation interventions known to improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Dynamic Changes of Brain Networks during Working Memory Tasks in Schizophrenia.",
      "abstract": "Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals and graph theory measures have been widely used to characterize the brain functional networks of healthy individuals and patients by calculating the correlations between different electrodes over an entire time series. Although EEG signals have a high temporal resolution and can provide relatively stable results, the process of constructing and analyzing brain functional networks is inevitably complicated by high time complexity. Our goal in this research was to distinguish the brain function networks of schizophrenia patients from those of healthy participants during working memory tasks. Consequently, we utilized a method involving microstates, which are each characterized by a unique topography of electric potentials over an entire channel array, to reduce the dimension of the EEG signals during working memory tasks and then compared and analyzed the brain functional networks using the microstates time series (MTS) and original time series (OTS) of the schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals. We found that the right frontal and parietal-occipital regions neurons of the schizophrenia patients were less active than those of the healthy participants during working memory tasks. Notably, compared with OTS, the time needed to construct the brain functional networks was significantly reduced by using MTS. In conclusion, our results show that, like OTS, MTS can well distinguish the brain functional network of schizophrenia patients from those of healthy individuals during working memory tasks while greatly decreasing time complexity. MTS can thus provide a method for characterizing the original time series for the construction and analysis of EEG brain functional networks.",

      "abstract": "Substantial evidence implicates working memory (WM) as a core deficit in schizophrenia (SCZ), purportedly due to primary deficits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functioning. Recent findings suggest that SCZ is also associated with abnormalities in suppression of certain regions during cognitive engagement--namely the default mode system--that may further contribute to WM pathology. However, no study has systematically examined activation and suppression abnormalities across both encoding and maintenance phases of WM in SCZ. Twenty-eight patients and 24 demographically matched healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T while performing a delayed match-to-sample WM task. Groups were accuracy matched to rule out performance effects. Encoding load was identical across subjects to facilitate comparisons across WM phases. We examined activation differences using an assumed model approach at the whole-brain level and within meta-analytically defined WM areas. Despite matched performance, we found regions showing less recruitment during encoding and maintenance for SCZ subjects. Furthermore, we identified 2 areas closely matching the default system, which SCZ subjects failed to deactivate across WM phases. Lastly, activation in prefrontal regions predicted the degree of deactivation for healthy but not SCZ subjects. Current results replicate and extend prefrontal recruitment abnormalities across WM phases in SCZ. Results also indicate deactivation abnormalities across WM phases, possibly due to inefficient prefrontal recruitment. Such regional deactivation may be critical for suppressing sources of interference during WM trace formation. Thus, deactivation deficits may constitute an additional source of impairments, which needs to be further characterized for a complete understanding of WM pathology in SCZ.",
