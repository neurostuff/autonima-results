    objective: "Identify fMRI studies of social related processing in healthy adults"
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Functional MRI scan conducted while human participants performed a social-related task. Relevant constructs include (but are not limited to) Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others.
      - At least one group of healthy participants, age 18–65, even if other groups include participants with psychiatric or neurological disorders.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - systematic reviews or meta-analyses
    confidence_reporting: true

    objective: "Identify fMRI studies of social related processing in healthy adults"
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Study uses functional MRI during a social-related task. Relevant constructs include (but are not limited to)- Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others.
      - Sample- At least one group of healthy adult participants (age 18–65). Studies that also include clinical or special groups are eligible only if results for the healthy group are reported separately.
      - Whole-brain evidence- The paper must report at least one group-level, whole-brain (voxelwise) task-evoked statistical map (e.g., main effect or within-group contrast) that is clearly identified as coming from the healthy/control group (i.e., not limited to a narrowly defined subgroup).
      - It is acceptable for qualifying whole-brain results to be reported in tables of coordinates, figures, or supplementary materials, as long as they are clearly described in the text.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - Studies that report only region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with no whole-brain results.
      - Studies that report only seed-based connectivity, effective connectivity (e.g., PPI, DCM), or resting-state analyses (e.g., ICA, PLE, Hurst exponents) without also reporting a healthy-group whole-brain task activation map.
      - Studies that report only between-group contrasts or interactions (e.g., subgroup vs subgroup, patient vs control) without an accompanying unmasked, whole-brain healthy-group task effect.
      - Studies that include only participants outside the age range of 18–65, unless a healthy adult subgroup in this range is analyzed and reported separately.
      - Non-empirical papers (e.g., reviews, meta-analyses, methods-only, simulations) without original fMRI data in healthy adults.
