      "reason": "Although the study uses a face-processing fMRI task in healthy young adults (social perception), it does not report group-level univariate whole-brain (voxelwise) task-evoked statistical maps for the healthy/control group. The imaging analyses are ROI-based interregional BOLD correlations and structural covariance across 25 predefined ROIs, with group comparisons performed on average correlation matrices. No whole-brain voxelwise activation maps or coordinate tables of healthy-group task activations are presented; therefore the study fails the \u2018whole-brain evidence\u2019 inclusion criterion.",
