      "reason": "Although the study includes a healthy adult control group (matched typically developing males, age range within 17\u201365) and uses task-evoked fMRI during a social cognition task, it does not report an unmasked, whole\u2011brain group-level activation map (or coordinates) for the healthy/control group alone. The paper reports between-group contrasts (typically developing > ASD) and regions where ASD shows reduced activity, but does not present a clearly identified, generalizable healthy-group whole\u2011brain task effect (e.g., one-sample healthy-group maps or coordinates). Per the review\u2019s inclusion criteria, a separate healthy-group whole-brain univariate result is required. Therefore the study must be excluded.",
