      - functional MRI scan while a human was completing a social-related task, including but not only following constructs:  Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others
      - at least 1 group of healthy participants, age 17-65, even if other groups have psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, as long as results for healthy participants are reported separately
      - the previous results must be whole-brain analyses (not only region of interest analyses). If both whole-brain and ROI analyses are reported, the study is included.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - only region of interest (ROI) analyses are reported
      - only reporting results among participants with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, or comparing such participants to healthy controls
