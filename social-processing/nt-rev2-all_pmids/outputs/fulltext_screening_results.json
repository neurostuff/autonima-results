The sample includes healthy young and older adult groups (young adults fall within the 17\u201365 range), and the abstract describes whole-brain activations (e.g., medial and lateral prefrontal cortex) associated with task conditions, indicating univariate voxelwise contrasts rather than ROI-only or connectivity-only analyses. Results are reported separately for healthy groups (young vs. older adults) and are generalizable to healthy adults. Therefore all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are violated.",

The paper reports whole-brain maps for age-related effects (adolescent-emergent and adolescent-specific predictors) and seed-based PPI connectivity, but it does not present an unmasked, group-level, whole-brain task-evoked activation map that is specific to and generalizable for a healthy adult-only group (age 17\u201365). Reported results are either age-modulated activations or seed-based connectivity; no standalone healthy-adult within-group whole-brain task activation is provided. Therefore it fails the inclusion criterion requiring a healthy adult whole-brain task map.",
