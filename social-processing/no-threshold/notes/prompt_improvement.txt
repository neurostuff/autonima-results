False Negatives at Abstract stage
- 24936688: Study with whole brain exploratory analyses was excluded, because ROI was mention in Abstract. Abstract should be more liberal and not consider ROI vs whole brain
- 30658938: Study excluded for having a clinical population--- but should have been included because there is a healthy control only result that was included. Don't exclude studies for not being EXCLUSIVELY non healthy
- 27716474: Study excluded for having ages outside range. Unfortuantely, 17 is technically outside the range, so not sure if that's a false negative. Should still it doesn't have to be exclusive.
- 24726338: Again, ROI analysis triggered exclusion, leave that to full text
- 28931014: Incorrectly not identified social-communication because it's a language task. Need to improve criteria to spell out all categories
- 24582805: Sample includes early adolescents (ages 11–14) alongside adults
