      "reason": "This study uses voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on MRI data to assess gray-matter volume and reports whole-brain VBM results (between-group contrast) comparing 9 PTSD patients to 16 trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls, including coordinate-based findings (left ACC peak at -8,12,32) and corrected statistical thresholds. Participants are trauma-exposed adults (Tokyo sarin-attack survivors). It directly addresses the review objective and meets all inclusion criteria (VBM method, PTSD group plus trauma-exposed comparison, whole-brain coordinate-based results). No exclusion criteria (ROI-only, non-PTSD, non-adult sample, longitudinal/treatment-only) are violated.",

The review\u2019s exclusion criteria require coordinate-based results for at least one PTSD vs control contrast. Additionally, key methodological/sample details (e.g., MRI specifics, exact group definitions, ages) are not available in the supplied text to confirm all inclusion criteria. Because the necessary coordinate-based whole-brain VBM results are not documented in the provided content, I must exclude the study.",

It reports manual ROI volumetry of the olfactory bulbs (and hippocampal tracing) from T2 MRI, not VBM measures of gray matter volume/concentration, and provides no coordinate-based, whole-brain VBM results comparing PTSD vs. trauma-exposed or trauma-unexposed groups. Thus it fails the primary inclusion criterion requiring VBM and whole-brain, coordinate-based between-group results. (Participants are adult and groups include PTSD and comparison groups, but the imaging method and reporting do not meet inclusion requirements.)",

Although the study includes adult PTSD cases and healthy controls and reports whole-brain cortical thickness differences, it does not report VBM coordinate-based whole-brain gray matter volume/concentration results.
