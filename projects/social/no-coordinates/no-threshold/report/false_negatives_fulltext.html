<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Background 
  
Successful social interaction relies on the ability to attribute mental states to other people. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have shown that this process, described as Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalization, is reliably associated with activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, this study presents a novel and surprising finding that provides new insight into the role of the mPFC in mentalization tasks. 


## Methodology/Principal Findings 
  
Twenty healthy individuals were recruited from a wide range of ages and social backgrounds. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing a well-established ToM visual paradigm involving moving triangles. Functional MRI data were analyzed using a classical general linear model. No activation was detected in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during movement patterns that typically elicit ToM. However, increased activity was observed in the right middle occipital gyrus, right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), left middle occipital gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus. No correlation was found between participants’ age and BOLD response. 


## Conclusions/Significance 
  
In contrast with previous neuroimaging research, our findings support the notion that mPFC function is not critical for reasoning about the mental states of others; furthermore, our data indicate that the right TPJ and right inferior frontal gyrus are able to perform mentalization without any contributions from the mPFC.

## Introduction 
  
To achieve successful social interaction, human beings must be able to think of other conspecifics as psychological agents whose behavior is driven by mental states. The process by which one attributes thoughts, intentions and beliefs to oneself and others is described as Theory of Mind (ToM) [ ] or mentalization [ ]. As demonstrated by Heider and Simmel 70 years ago, this process is fundamentally imprinted in the human brain [ ]. In response to simple animated stimuli (e.g., two triangles and a circle that move against or around each other and/or a rectangle), nearly all healthy individuals automatically perceive intentionality and attribute mental states to other entities (e.g., the moving shapes). 

ToM tasks activate a large-scale brain network that consists of cortical midline structures such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the precuneus, as well as lateral parietal regions such as the posterior temporal sulcus (i.e., the temporoparietal junction, TPJ) and the temporal pole [ – ]. The mPFC has been specifically identified as being a crucial node within the ToM network [ ,  – ]. However, it is controversial to assume that mPFC activity is necessary for ToM. For instance, one study reported a single case of extensive frontal lobe damage that did not affect the patient’s ToM ability [ ]. However, it remains unclear whether this finding can be generalized to other populations. 

Considering the body of previous research, this study analyzed a group of healthy individuals who were originally recruited as controls for a naturalistic fMRI study that assessed social understanding and mPFC function in pain disorder. The current study led to a surprising result: mPFC activation was not detected during a ToM task. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty healthy right-handed, German-speaking individuals of Caucasian ethnicity [ ] were recruited from a broad range of ages (7 male, 13 female; mean-age 45.6 years, SD = 14.01, range 24–64 years) and educational backgrounds. Participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Most of the subjects were participants (“control group”) of other neuroimaging studies performed by our research group [ – ]. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Rechts der Isar Hospital, Technical University of Munich. All participants were screened by trained physicians to rule out any neurological or psychiatric disorders. 


### Stimuli 
  
The eight silent visual animations that were used in this experiment have been validated by previous functional imaging studies [ – ]. In each animation, two shapes, a small blue triangle and a large red triangle, moved against a white background. Two types of animations were depicted, which represent two different types of social interaction; there were a total of four ToM movies and four random movement movies (R) used in this experiment. The ToM sequence portrayed the triangles coaxing, mocking, seducing and surprising each other [ ]. The R sequence was used as a control condition and portrayed the triangles moving or rotating around the background without any intentional interaction. For this study, all of the videos were cropped to the same length (36 sec), leaving the relevant content untouched. A personal computer running the ´Presentation´ software (Neurobehavioural Systems,   http://www.neurobs.com  ) projected stimuli onto a screen utilizing a projector and mirror mount. 


### Scanning method and procedure 
  
First, participants completed a training session before the fMRI scan was performed, to familiarize themselves with the stimuli and scanning procedure. During this training session, two videos were presented in a randomized order (one from each of the two conditions); these videos were not utilized during the fMRI session. 

During the fMRI scanning session, 8 video stimuli (4 from each category) were presented in a block design. Each stimulus appeared only once during the entire task and represented one block. Each block was followed by a blank screen that was of the same length as the baseline condition, resulting in a total scanning time of 576 sec (8 blocks and 8 baseline conditions at 36 sec each). For each participant, videos were drawn in random order from a library of 8 videos. 

Echo planar imaging (EPI) was acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva Scanner (Philips Medical Systems) fitted with a standard 8-channel SENSE head coil. A total of 32 contiguous slices (i.e., no gap), with steep angulation to exclude the eyes, were acquired using a gradient echo EPI sequence utilizing the following parameters: 2000 ms TR; 35 ms TE; 82 degree flip angle; 220 mm FOV; 4 mm slice thickness; 80x80 matrix; voxel size 2.75x2.75 mm; SENSE factor 2. Structural images were obtained using a T1-weighted turbo gradient echo sequence utilizing the following parameters: 9 ms TR; 4 ms TE; 8 degree flip angle; 240 mm FOV; 240x240 matrix; voxel size 1 mm isotropic; 170 slices; no gap. 

Immediately after the fMRI session, participants underwent a debriefing session, during which the stimuli were shown again in the same order. After each video clip, each participant was asked a standardized open-ended question ("What happened?") and allowed to provide his/her response without any time restrictions. The answers were recorded, transcribed, rated, and analyzed by averaging the ratings of two independent, trained medical scientists. Ratings were performed according to the original ToM paradigm, using an established scale ranging from 1 to 5 to measure the grade of intentionality attributed to the stimuli [ ] ( ).

### Data analysis 
  
Statistical parametric mapping (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London) was utilized for the realignment and coregistration of the EPI-images into T1-weighted images. After transforming the data onto the anatomical space of a template brain (Montreal Neurological Institute), the normalized images were smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. 

The first level of our analysis was a subject-wise computation using the functional general linear model. Then, a comparison of the estimates by means of linear contrasts was performed for each animation to determine the specific effects of the different conditions. The resulting set of voxels constituted a statistical parametric map of the t-statistic. The following contrast was computed: “ToM > R”, “ToM > Baseline”, and “R > Baseline”. Correlation analyses were performed between the imaging data and the results of the post-scan intentionality ratings. 

Furthermore, a Bayesian analysis was performed to test whether or not the null-hypothesis—i. e.no activation in the mPFC–can be accepted [ ]. Given the changes in the regional cerebral blood flow illustrated by Castelli et al. [ ], where responses in an mPFC region were similar to that in the superior temporal sulcus, the “theory” to evualuate using Bayes factors is that the response in the mPFC is the same as the response in the right superior temporal gyrus region (which showed a significant “ToM > R”-activity). The following volumes of interest in the mPFC were defined based on peaks (Talairach-Coordinates) found in previous studies (small volume of interest analysis, radius = 15 mm): 12 63 17 and 10 62 30 [ ], 14 63 13 and 4 50 29 [ ], and -6 58 32 [ ]. Furthermore, a volume of interest in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus was defined based on the peak in our study (MNI-Coordinates 54–48 16). The mean BOLD signal change within the volumes of interests was calculated. For the Bayesian analysis, a normal distribution was presumed. 


### Statistical thresholds 
  
For the whole-brain analysis, we applied an   a priori   threshold of p < 0.001 for uncorrected data at the voxel level and a threshold of p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the cluster level (cluster-extent threshold > 1 voxel). For the correlation-analyses, we used an   a priori   threshold of p < 0.01 for uncorrected data at the voxel level and a threshold of p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the cluster level (cluster-extent threshold > 1 voxel). For the Bayesian analysis, Bayes-Factors < 1/3 give substantial evidence for the null-hypothesis over the alternate hypothesis [ ]. 



## Results 
  
Our comparison of the ToM versus R conditions showed a significant signal increase in the right middle occipital gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (  and  ). 
   Activations during the “ToM > R” analysis (whole-brain analysis;   a priori   p < 0.001 for uncorrected data at the voxel level and p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the cluster level; cluster-extent threshold > 1 voxel; * = also significant at p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the voxel level; color bars represent T-values).       Activations during the “ToM > R” analysis (whole-brain analysis;   a priori   p < 0.001 for uncorrected data at the voxel level and p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the cluster level; cluster-extent threshold > 1 voxel; * = also significant at p < 0.05 when data were corrected for family-wise-errors at the voxel level).      
No significant activation was seen in the mPFC, even at the more lenient threshold of p < 0.01 (uncorrected at the voxel level). 

No significant correlation was seen between the imaging results and the post-can intentionality ratings. 

The comparison of the ToM versus Baseline conditions showed a significant signal increase in the right inferior occipital gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right thalamus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus (  and  ). The comparison of the R versus Baseline conditions showed a significant signal increase in the left superior parietal lobule, left superior frontal gyrus, left thalamus, and right middle frontal gyrus (  and  ). The Bayesian analysis provided substantial evidence (Bayes-Factor < 1/3) that “ToM > R” does not elicit significant activation [ ] ( ). 
   Bayesian analysis to evaluate the theory that the response in the mPFC is the same as the response in the right superior temporal gyrus during “ToM > R” (volume of interest (VOI): mPFC-coordinates based on literature, right posterior superior temporal gyrus coordinates based on our sample (MNI: 54–48 16), radius 15 mm; mean and standard deviation (SD) represent the average BOLD-signal within a volume of interest).      

## Discussion 
  
In this study, we examined the neural representations of ToM in healthy participants using a well-established fMRI paradigm. 

In contrast to the vast majority of imaging studies on ToM (for review see [ ,  – ]), mPFC activation was not detected in our study. Furthermore, our findings expand on the results of recent studies on brain lesions and present an additional piece of evidence to refute the assumption that mPFC activity is essential for mentalization in adults [ ,  ]. 

There is converging evidence supporting the notion that, on a functional level, the mPFC is not ToM-specific but domain-general [ ] because this region has been implicated in various psychological processes (e.g., default mode activity, autobiographic memory, self-reflection, prospection, and predicting preferences), personality traits, emotional empathy and affective regulation [ ,  – ]. For example, the ventral mPFC contributes to emotional ToM [ ] in terms of empathic concern for another person’s affective state [ ,  – ], whereas the dorsal mPFC mediates “triadic attention” and collaboration [ ] (i.e., when two persons pay attention to the same object [ ,  ]). MPFC function can be synoptically described as the neural basis of self-referential thinking, a process that typically arises when an environmental stimulus is specifically relevant to one’s own tasks. However, the mere observation of two social agents interacting with each other may not necessarily be personally salient to an observer and does not automatically require self-related processes such as joint attention or emotional concern [ ]. Our findings support the notion that mPFC activity is not involved in mentalization itself; rather, it contributes to the self-related processes that are often associated with ToM. 

Moreover, one may speculate that the mPFC is crucial only for the acquisition of ToM during childhood and adolescence, because it does not appear to be relevant for mentalization during adulthood. In this context, mPFC activation has been shown to shift from the ventral to dorsal region during maturation, whereas no age-related changes were found in the TPJ and temporal poles [ ]. Furthermore, there appears to be a developmental trajectory from higher to lower activation in the mPFC and adjacent paracingulate gyrus [ ,  ]. Although research on mentalization during normal aging or psychogenesis is still in its infancy, the existing results suggest an immense plasticity of ToM functions, which can likely be adopted by other areas of the brain besides than the mPFC. 

In agreement with previous research [ – ,  ], our study found activation within the right TPJ and inferior frontal gyrus. Unlike the mPFC, there is converging evidence to support the notion that the right TPJ is a critical region for ToM [ – ]. This region supports various cognitive tasks, including ToM, empathy, the perception of agency, and attentional reorientation to salient stimuli [ – ]. However, it is unclear if a common psychobiological mechanism (involved in both attention and ToM) exists and is performed by this region or if mentalization relies on a distinct module within the posterior region of the right TPJ, as suggested by Scholz et al. (2009) and Young et al. [ ]. Our study also found activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, which is a region that has been reliably associated with social cognition (for review see [ ]). As with the right TPJ, the right inferior frontal gyrus is activated when salient cues are detected and is also involved in attentional reorientation [ ]. The TPJ and inferior frontal gyrus appear to be sufficient for ToM without contribution from the mPFC; this finding highlights the pivotal role of these regions in mentalization. 

In summary, our report indicates that mPFC function is neither selective nor necessary for cognitive ToM [ ]. However, further direct experimental imaging studies will be crucial to explore whether a ToM-related neural network exists, in which the mPFC, TPJ and inferior frontal gyrus can be flexibly integrated, or whether an innate ToM module specifically instantiates reasoning about the mental state of others.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> Although this fMRI study used healthy adult participants (ages 21–46) and reports whole-brain analyses in addition to ROI work, the experimental task centered on viewing erotic pictures and videos to probe sexual arousal and incentive motivation related to sexual orientation. The meta-analysis requires studies to involve a social-related task (e.g., social cognition, mentalizing, face/voice social evaluation). The present study’s primary objective and measures are sexual/affective processing of erotic stimuli rather than social cognitive processing per se.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
We used fMRI to investigate neural correlates of responses to erotic pictures and videos in heterosexual (N = 26), bisexual (N = 26), and homosexual (N = 24) women, ages 25–50. We focused on the ventral striatum, an area of the brain associated with desire, extending previous findings from the sexual psychophysiology literature in which homosexual women had greater category specificity (relative to heterosexual and bisexual women) in their responses to male and female erotic stimuli. We found that homosexual women’s subjective and neural responses reflected greater bias towards female stimuli, compared with bisexual and heterosexual women, whose responses did not significantly differ. These patterns were also suggested by whole brain analyses, with homosexual women showing category-specific activations of greater extents in visual and auditory processing areas. Bisexual women tended to show more mixed patterns, with activations more responsive to female stimuli in sensory processing areas, and activations more responsive to male stimuli in areas associated with social cognition.

## Introduction 
  
Studies using physiological measures have found that women tend to have non-specific patterns of genital arousal . That is, in contrast to men, women tend to show similar degrees of arousal to erotic stimuli depicting either sex. For example, heterosexual women have generally shown equivalent arousal to both erotic stimuli featuring men and erotic stimuli featuring women. This has been repeatedly demonstrated with vaginal photoplethysmography . This pattern has also been found using less direct measures such as looking time , pupil dilation , and fMRI . Notably, homosexual women’s arousal patterns are more category-specific than heterosexual women’s, although less so than men’s . 

The fact that women’s sexual arousal patterns are less category-specific than men’s has been interpreted as a potential contributor to gender differences in “erotic plasticity” , which Baumeister has defined as “the extent to which sex drive is shaped by social, cultural, and situational factors.” 

Baumeister offered three lines of evidence when he initially proposed that women may have greater erotic plasticity compared with men: (1) women show larger effects of social and cultural factors on sexual attitudes, desire, and behavior; (2) sexual attitude-behavior consistency is lower in women than in men; (3) individual women exhibit more variation in sexual behavior across time than men. Women’s less specific arousal patterns may also contribute to their increased “sexual fluidity” , which Diamond has defined as an individual’s “capacity for situation-dependent flexibility in sexual responsiveness, which allows individuals to experience changes in same-sex or other-sex desire across both short-term and long-term time periods” . 

One might hypothesize that arousal patterns of bisexual women should be similar to the non-specific arousal patterns of heterosexual women; however, studies of women’s arousal patterns have mostly neglected to include bisexual women. Heterosexual women’s arousal does not appear to favor erotic stimuli of either sex, and thus may be considered to reflect a bisexual pattern. (We do not mean to imply that heterosexual women are confused or in denial about their “real preferences”; rather, the findings in need of explanation are why heterosexual women show non-heterosexual arousal patterns in the laboratory). The implication of women’s non-specific arousal patterns for their sexual orientations is difficult to interpret. Most women, like most men, behave and identify heterosexually . However, men are more likely than women to identify as completely heterosexual or completely homosexual, and women are more likely than men to identify as bisexual or “mostly heterosexual” . 

If arousal patterns are similar between heterosexual and bisexual women, the question remains what distinguishes the two groups. One possibility, supported by some research, is that bisexual women tend to have greater sexual motivation, which may increase the likelihood of exploring a capacity for attraction to both sexes . Or, bisexual women may be more aware than heterosexual women of their non-specific arousal , which could partially contribute to bisexual sexual motivation. Alternatively, bisexual women may be more likely than heterosexual women to interpret their non-specific arousal states in sexual or romantic terms. 

It is also possible that bisexual women’s arousal patterns differ from those observed in heterosexual women. Consistent with this possibility, recent studies suggest that women with bisexual interests tend to be more aroused by female than by male erotic stimuli . Perhaps for some women with female-biased arousal patterns, this bias can motivate non-heterosexual feelings, behavior, and identity. 

Interpretations of non-specific arousal patterns in women are further complicated by the fact that female genital arousal exhibits relatively low correlations with subjectively reported sexual arousal, in contrast to the high correlations observed in men . Discrepancies between existing genital and subjective measures indicate that some women may report substantial subjective arousal without substantial genital arousal, and vice versa. It has also been suggested that non-specific arousal patterns may not indicate affective responses to erotic stimuli, but may instead reflect a kind of protective preparatory response . 

Neuroimaging assessments may shed light on the neural systems that are involved in responding to a given paradigm. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging approach that allows for the indirect assessment of brain activity by tracking ratios of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood a proxy for neural firing. When used in the context of presenting erotic stimuli, this non-invasive neural measure could provide a converging line of evidence for interpreting the genital and subjective arousal findings described above. In this study, we used fMRI to specifically focused on the “reward system” in order to address the question: to what extent is there an affective significance to findings from the literature on women’s sexual orientation and genital arousal? 

The part of the “reward system” that we focused on is the ventral striatum, a dopamine-sensitive area of the brain that is a reliable measure of reward-related processing–and in particular, wanting and “incentive motivation” –including with respect to sexual orientation . Most neuroimaging studies of sexual response have focused on men , but the ventral striatum has also been found to reliably activate in studies of women’s responses to erotic stimuli . However, until now, no studies have measured neural responses to erotic stimuli in bisexual women. 

The present investigation primarily focused on two hypotheses: (1) Homosexual women may show greater category-specificity than non-homosexual women in brain activity, as suggested by the genital arousal literature; (2) Bisexual women may show larger biases towards female stimuli, compared with heterosexual women. We tested these hypotheses with respect to subjective and neural responses to erotic pictures and erotic videos. We used two different kinds of erotic stimuli because of their potentially non-overlapping strengths and weaknesses. Erotic pictures may be particularly well-suited for assessing the initial appraisal of sexual stimuli, but their brevity may not reflect the kinds of experiences that drive sexuality in the real world. Erotic videos may allow for the measurement of more intense states, but their extended duration may also provide opportunities for self-regulatory efforts to modify erotic responses. 


## Method 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were 26 heterosexual women, 26 bisexual women, and 24 homosexual women, recruited from a variety of publicly-posted and online advertisements seeking (paid) volunteers for a neuroimaging study of sexual orientation and arousal. Bisexual women were required to have had at least two previous sexual partners and one romantic partner (of three months or greater duration) of each sex. Homosexual and heterosexual participants all met these criteria with respect to their respective preferred sexes. 

After responding to advertisements, participants were screened for inclusion using online questionnaires. Participants provided information about sexual orientation, sexual interests, and personality, in addition to answering screening questions relevant to medical eligibility for fMRI research. Participants were required to be right handed, non-claustrophobic, free from ferromagnetic implants, and not currently taking psychiatric medications. Participants were informed of the risks and nature of the study and agreed to participate in all portions of the research. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University and carried out in accordance with its guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from each participant for every portion of the study in which they participated. 

Participants’ sexual orientation was assessed using self-reported identities (i.e. “Homosexual”/“Gay”, “Bisexual”/“Bi”, “Heterosexual”/“Straight”), as well as with a modified Kinsey score, which asked participants about their sexual fantasies throughout adulthood as well as in the past year. The scale ranged from 0 to 6, with 0 corresponding to an exclusively heterosexual orientation and 6 corresponding to an exclusively homosexual orientation. Responses to questions about adulthood and about the past year were averaged to create a Kinsey score for each participant. The average Kinsey score was 0.8 for heterosexual women (  SD   = 0.7,   range   = 0–2), 2.63 for bisexual women (  SD   = 0.7,   range   = 2–4.5), and 5.2 for homosexual women (  SD   = 0.68,   range   = 4–6). 

Participants’ ages ranged from 21 to 46 years old. Mean ages were 29.7 for heterosexual women (  SD   = 5.86,   range   = 25–46), 30.27 for bisexual women (  SD   = 6.41,   range   = 21–48), and 29 for homosexual women (  SD   = 3.12,   range   = 25–38). The sample of 76 participants was racially and ethnically diverse, with 23 non-Caucasian participants including two Latina participants, ten African-American participants, four Asian-American participants, and seven participants who identified otherwise or who identified as multiethnic/multiracial. Groups did not significantly differ either with respect to age (  F  (2,73) = 0.348,   p   = 0.708) or ethnicity (c (2, N = 76) = 2.94, p = 0.23). We also confirmed that ethnicity did not significantly impact responses to the erotic stimuli. 


### Stimuli and Procedure 
  
Subjects experienced two experimental paradigms in the scanner: first erotic pictures were shown (over a period of ~21 minutes), and then erotic videos were shown (over a period of ~19 minutes) after a brief rest period. Picture stimuli were shown before video stimuli for all participants in an attempt to promote stimulus engagement. That is, it was assumed that potentially less intense stimuli might be better presented earlier in the experimental session while attentional resources are highest. Further, there was concern that first showing more intense stimuli would reduce engagement with subsequent stimuli. As such, pictures and videos stimuli were not counterbalanced with respect to each other. 

Participants watched stimuli while laying down with a combination of earplugs (to minimize scanner noise) and over-ear headphones (for video sound and communication with experimenters). Images were displayed via projector onto a wall, which was made viewable to participants via an angled mirror placed above the eyes. 

#### Erotic pictures paradigm 
  
The present study employed a subset of the picture stimuli used in Safron   et al  .  and Sylva   et al  . . Pictures depicted a nude man, a nude woman, or a same-sex couple (i.e., either two men or two women) engaged in explicit sexual contact. Erotic stimuli featuring both individual nudes and same-sex pairs engaging in explicit sexual interaction is common in research on sexual arousal and sexual orientation , which is not the case when stimuli featuring male-female couples is presented. However, erotic stimuli featuring explicit sexual activity in same-sex couples tends to be substantially more arousing compared with pictures of single nudes . Such stimuli are similar to pictures of nude individuals, in the sense that only men or women, but not both, are depicted in a given picture. Thus, sexual arousal induced by them is relatively unambiguous in terms of the gender to which participants are responding. 

In each of two 10.5-minute runs (ordering counterbalanced), participants viewed 40 erotic pictures featuring male models and 40 erotic pictures featuring female models. Each picture was shown for 3.5 seconds, followed by a variable-duration fixation cross presented for either 1.5, 6.5, or 11.5 seconds. Variable-duration baselines were utilized for superior deconvolution of the BOLD signal in a rapid event-related design for fMRI (in which evoked signals are never allowed to return to baseline levels). During the presentation of each picture, participants used buttons held in their right hands to rate that image on a scale of −2 to +2 (respectively: “strongly disliked,” “disliked,” “liked,” “strongly liked”), with no option of 0 for neutral ratings. Neutral options for ratings were not provided for the sake of consistency with previous research using the same stimuli. Note: Subjective ratings of pictures were lost for some participants due to a button-box equipment error. 


#### Erotic videos paradigm 
  
Following picture assessment, participants were shown six video clips depicting individual masturbating men and six video clips depicting individual masturbating women. Depicted individuals appeared sexually aroused but did not reach orgasm. To estimate baseline responses, six natural landscape videos were shown. 

In each of two 9.25-minute runs (ordering counterbalanced), videos were presented for 15 seconds each, followed by a 15-second distraction task requiring participants to indicate via button-press when a number in a series decreased by an interval other than seven. This task was intended to facilitate a return to emotional and physiological baseline. 15-second stimulus presentations were chosen as a desirable stimulation period in an fMRI block design, which can potentially be more sensitive than event-related designs . 

After leaving the scanner, participants viewed the videos once more and provided ratings of each clip. Videos were rated using a 5-point scale for degree of sexual appeal, ranging from “not at all” (0) to “very much” (4), with a midpoint of “somewhat” (2).’ 



### fMRI signal extraction methods 
  
#### Image acquisition 
  
A Siemens Trio 3 T magnet and 12-channel RF head coil were used to collect T2*-weighted gradient-recalled EPI images from the whole brain (32 3-mm slices with a 0.99-mm interslice gap; TR = 2500 ms; TE = 20 ms; flip angle = 80°; FOV = 200 × 220 mm, 120 × 128 acquisition matrix). Slices were taken along the plane connecting the anterior and posterior commissures, with a 1.72 mm × 1.72 mm × 3.99 mm resolution, with more refined axial dimensions intended to produce less distortion and signal dropout in sub-cortical areas, although possibly at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio. During each picture run, 250 whole-brain volumes were collected, and during each video run, 220 whole-brain volumes were collected, with the first four volumes discarded to account for initial magnetization effects. For anatomical localization, a structural MRI scan consisting of T1-weighted images was conducted after the testing runs (160 1-mm axial slices; TR = 2.1 ms; TE = 4.38 ms; flip angle = 15°; FOV = 220 mm; 256 × 192 matrix). 


#### Image pre-processing 
  
Image pre-processing and analysis was performed using SPM 12b (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK), and implemented in Matlab v 8.1.604 (The MathWorks Inc., MA, USA). 

Functional (EPI) volumes were first corrected for slice timing. Each participant’s volumes were then registered to the mean slice, after which the registered volumes were resliced, used to create a mean resliced image, and then co-registered to the structural (T1) image. All EPI images, including the mean resliced image, as well as the structural (T1) scans were then spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and re-sampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm (27 mm ) resolution. Normalized functional images were then smoothed to an 8 mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. 


#### Signal to noise ratio and head coverage exclusions 
  
To exclude participants with poor signal due to either head motion or scanner conditions, average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over time was calculated for each subject (after preprocessing, using a mask that included only voxels with appreciable EPI signal). The SNR ratio for each voxel (mean divided by standard deviation) was averaged across all voxels in the brain . Participants whose picture data SNR was less than one standard deviation below the mean were excluded from picture analyses. Similarly, participants whose video data SNR was less than one standard deviation below the mean were excluded from video analyses. 

Based on these criteria, fourteen participants (five heterosexual, five bisexual, and four homosexual) were excluded from fMRI and subjective picture analyses, and sixteen participants (six heterosexual, six bisexual, and four homosexual) were excluded from fMRI and subjective video analyses. After exclusions were performed for SNR, we included a total of twenty-one heterosexual women, twenty-one bisexual women, and twenty homosexual women in fMRI picture analyses. Video analyses after SNR exclusion included eighteen heterosexual women, eighteen bisexual women, and twenty homosexual women. To check the validity of our SNR criterion, head motion plots were visually inspected for all participants (Parrish,   et al  . ). Excluded participants had highly variable head positions as compared to included participants. An additional validity-check was performed using evoked responses to erotic pictures minus a fixation-cross baseline. Excluded participants had substantially reduced activity in visual cortices as compared to included participants. 

An additional thirty-two participants (twelve heterosexual, twelve bisexual, and eight homosexual) were excluded from subjective picture rating analyses due to insufficient subjective data resulting from a button-box equipment error. Five participants (three bisexual and two homosexual) were excluded from subjective video analyses for the same reason. Thus, after exclusions were performed for insufficient subjective data, we included a total of nine heterosexual women, nine bisexual women, and twelve homosexual women in subjective picture analyses, and twenty heterosexual women, seventeen bisexual women, and eighteen homosexual women in subjective video analyses. 

For whole-brain analyses, mean functional scans were individually examined to identify participants with substantial cutoffs in head coverage. As a result, one heterosexual female who had substantial frontal lobe cutoff was excluded from whole-brain analyses in addition to those participants excluded for SNR. 


#### First-level analyses 
  
For both the video and picture assessments, a standard general linear model (GLM)  was used in identifying hemodynamic changes for each participant, and a high-pass filter (cutoff 128 s) was used to remove low-frequency temporal noise. 

Estimated average activity was calculated for each participant’s separate responses to male pictures, female pictures, male videos, and female videos (contrasted with fixation cross for pictures and neutral nature scenes for videos). These estimates were used for region of interest analyses. For whole-brain analyses, estimated average activity was also calculated for each participant’s response to male compared with female pictures and videos. For both the picture and video assessments, each participant’s responses to each stimulus contrast of interest were concatenated within stimulus type, using data from both the 1  and 2  runs. 

Ventral striatum region of interest analyses. An a priori region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on the ventral striatum—centered on the nucleus accumbens—as this was the area most likely to indicate desire. The ventral striatum and hypothalamus are the only two areas that have been shown to be specifically associated with sexual (as opposed to general) arousal . We focused on the ventral striatum because it likely has higher validity for reflecting sexual incentive value compared with the hypothalamus, which contains a variety of nuclei with heterogeneous functions (including sexual arousal) that would be difficult to disambiguate with the limited spatial resolution of 3 T fMRI. 

The ventral striatum ROI mask used in the present study was drawn on an MNI template brain using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox for SPM 8 . It was anatomically defined as a dilated intersection of the ventral anterior caudate and putamen. The resulting ventral striatum ROI is shown in Fig.  .

Estimates of average ventral striatum activity for each participant were extracted using the MarsBar toolbox for SPM8 . Extracted ventral striatum ROI data were analyzed using JMP Pro v11 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 



### Planned contrasts and within-group tests 
  
We constructed separate dependent variables for each combination of stimulus type (i.e. picture or video) and response type (i.e., subjective or ventral striatum activation) by subtracting response to female stimuli from response to male stimuli. That is, we constructed dependent variables for 1) subjective response to pictures, 2) subjective response to videos, 3) ventral striatum activation to pictures, and 4) ventral striatum responses to videos, each of which reflected responses to male stimuli minus responses to female stimuli. We refer to this as the Male-Female contrast. 

Because there were three groups (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual women), two orthogonal between-groups contrasts were constructed to examine what we believe to be the most interesting pair of independent questions based on previous literature . The first question was whether homosexual women differed from the other two groups in their Male-Female contrasts. The second question was whether bisexual women differed from heterosexual women in their Male-Female contrasts. The use of orthogonal planned contrasts allowed us to test these hypotheses with maximum statistical power while simultaneously minimizing the number of overall comparisons. 

Within-group t-tests were also performed separately in each group in order to characterize relative responding to male and female stimuli. 


### Whole-brain analyses 
  
Finally, we examined overall patterns of differential activation in response to male compared with female erotic stimuli across the entire brain. If bisexual and heterosexual women have less specific arousal patterns, then they are likely to exhibit less extensive differential activity between male and female stimuli compared with the activity patterns expected for homosexual women. 

Tests of average group responses to stimulus conditions were performed using one-sample contrasts. Each group (heterosexual women, bisexual women, and homosexual women) was tested individually for clusters of greater activity for male stimuli compared with female stimuli, and female stimuli compared with male stimuli, using a corrected statistical threshold (p < 0.05 FWE). 

For these analyses, cluster reports were generated in SPM. Peak activations and cluster extents (extent threshold k = 5) were visually examined as overlays on slice and render maps. Neuroanatomical descriptions were determined based on agreement between two trained investigators, and checked against designations from the WFU Atlas (Maldjian   et al  ., 2003).

## Results 
  
### Between-group planned contrasts 
  
As previously described, planned comparisons for the ventral striatum ROI were conducted via multiple regression using two orthogonal between-groups contrasts: one comparing homosexual women with heterosexual and bisexual women, and one comparing heterosexual with bisexual women. Separate analyses were conducted for each of the Male-Female contrasts (i.e., responses to female stimuli subtracted from responses to male stimuli). Results are presented in Table  .

#### Homosexual versus non-homosexual women 
  
Subjective ratings. Compared with non-homosexual women, homosexual women had significantly more negative (i.e., gynephilic) Male-Female contrasts for both pictures (p = 0.015) and videos (p < 0.001). That is, homosexual women showed a greater preference for pictures and videos of females relative to males, compared with both bisexual and heterosexual women. 

Ventral striatum activation patterns. Homosexual women had significantly more female-biased ventral striatum responses compared to non-homosexual women for pictures (p = 0.002), but not videos. 


#### Bisexual versus heterosexual women 
  
We compared heterosexual and bisexual women’s subjective and ventral striatum responses to erotic pictures and videos, and observed only one significant difference: for video stimuli, bisexual women had significantly more female-preferring subjective responses than did heterosexual women (p = 0.026). 



### Within-group tests comparing responses to male and female erotic stimuli 
  
Figure   (showing the distribution of Male-Female contrasts for the three groups) shows that heterosexual women exhibited a non-significant trend (p = 0.079) towards favoring female erotic pictures compared with male erotic pictures, and had no differentiation between stimulus sex for other tests. Bisexual women also did not subjectively differentiate among stimulus types based on sex, although they did exhibit (non-significant) marginal female-favoring ventral striatum scores for picture (p = 0.063) and video (p = 0.054) stimuli. Homosexual women, in contrast to heterosexual and bisexual women, showed clear favoring of female stimuli as assessed by subjective liking of pictures (p < 0.001), appeal ratings of videos (p < 0.001), as well as in ventral striatum responses to pictures (p = 0.003) and non-significantly for ventral striatum responses to videos (p = 0.073). Note that these results are presented descriptively. Inferences about differences among the three groups depend on the tests presented in Table  . 


### Whole brain tests comparing responses to male and female erotic stimuli 
  
Note: Activation patterns are described in greater detail in the discussion, with interpretations of possible functional significances. 

#### Picture stimuli 
  
Comparing activation to female versus male erotic pictures, heterosexual women exhibited relatively greater activity for female pictures in occipital (i.e., visual) and occipitotemporal cortices, with no brain areas showing significantly greater activation for male pictures (Fig.  ; Table  ). Bisexual women also showed greater activity in visual cortices for female relative to male pictures, but they showed greater activity for male pictures in other areas including supramarginal and angular gyri, as well as the posterior cingulate. Homosexual women exhibited significant activations for female compared with male pictures in visual cortex, parietal lobes, and parahippocampal cortex, but with no brain areas showing significantly greater activation for male pictures.

#### Video stimuli 
  
When viewing female compared with male erotic videos (Fig.  ; Table  ), all groups showed activity in bilateral superior temporal cortices, likely indicating an auditory confound in which more extensive and substantial vocalizations were present in female erotic videos . However, this effect appeared to vary by sexual orientation, with homosexual women showing the most extensive and robust evoked activity (peak T = 14.22) compared with heterosexual (peak T = 11.71) and bisexual women (peak T = 8.83). In the opposite direction of greater responses to male compared with female erotic videos, heterosexual and bisexual (but not homosexual) women exhibited activations in occipital cortices. While all groups had greater activity towards male videos in (anterior) superior parietal cortices, these activations appeared to be more extensive and robust in bisexual women (peak T = 11.55) compared with heterosexual (peak T = 7.64) and homosexual women (peak T = 7.99).

## Discussion 
  
In this fMRI study of female sexual orientation—the first to include bisexual women—we extended several key findings from the sexual psychophysiology literature . Using the ventral striatum as a neural measure of incentive motivation, we demonstrated that homosexual women have greater gender bias in their responses to male and female erotic stimuli. 

### Main findings: subjective and ventral striatum responses to male and female erotic stimuli 
  
Direct comparisons of bisexual and heterosexual women revealed no significant differences, with the exception of bisexual women having more gynephilic subjective responses to erotic videos. However, bisexual and heterosexual women did not differ with respect to their ventral striatum responses toward these stimuli. When contrasted to bisexual and heterosexual women, homosexual women showed distinctly greater bias toward female stimuli in both their subjective responses to videos and pictures, and also in their ventral striatum responses to pictures. In sum, our planned contrast findings are consistent with the genital arousal literature in which more category-specific responses were observed in homosexual women . 

Another set of tests, comparing male vs. female stimuli within each group, revealed that neither bisexual nor heterosexual women were significantly biased toward stimuli depicting males or stimuli depicting females. This was true both in ventral striatum response and in subjective arousal, for both picture and video stimuli. Homosexual women, however, were uniquely gynephilic (i.e., female-preferring), with significantly greater responses to female stimuli for subjective responses to pictures, subjective responses to videos, and ventral striatum responses to pictures. This gynephilic bias in homosexual women was consistent with our direct comparisons and previous literature. 

Our findings are only partially consistent with observations from the genital arousal literature in which homosexual and bisexual women both had gynephilic responses, but where heterosexual women had non-specific responses . We found significant biases in ventral striatum responses toward female stimuli among homosexual women, but with more indifferent patterns among heterosexual and bisexual women. However, with one exception—bisexual women showing more gynephilic subjective responses to erotic videos than did heterosexual women, in a direct comparison—heterosexual and bisexual women’s patterns of results did not differ significantly. 

Our a priori tests in the ventral striatum allowed us to explore whether women of different sexual orientations also exhibited different degrees of incentive motivation toward male and female erotic stimuli. But fMRI also provides the ability to look at activation patterns across the entire brain, potentially allowing for a more detailed characterization of the neural systems involved. Below we review activation patterns for each group in viewing male compared with female erotic stimuli, along with some reverse inferences as to their functional significance. 


### Whole brain responses to erotic pictures 
  
For heterosexual women viewing erotic pictures, activity was greater for female relative to male stimuli bilaterally in lateral occipital cortices, likely indicative of visual attention , as well as in right-lateralized fusiform cortex, potentially suggesting face or body processing .   In no brain areas did heterosexual women have significantly greater activation for male relative to female erotic pictures  . Rather, they seemed to have a somewhat gynephilic pattern of visual attention, consistent with results from eye-tracking and looking-time studies in which heterosexual women attended to erotic characteristics of female pictures . 

Bisexual women showed more activity in response to female (relative to male) erotic pictures throughout the visual system, including fusiform cortex, which (as described above) is often associated with perception of faces and bodies . Patterns were similar to those observed in heterosexual women (and presumably with similar functional significances), but with larger spatial extents of activation. Although bisexual and heterosexual women were not directly contrasted, this more extensive visual activation could be taken as support for somewhat greater gynephilic interest on the part of bisexual women, consistent with ventral striatum activation patterns. 

For bisexual women viewing erotic pictures, activity was greater for male relative to female stimuli in posterior midcingulate and right retrosplenial cingulate cortices, potentially suggesting greater perceptual salience and emotional memory for male erotic stimuli . Additional male-biased activations were identified bilaterally in supramarginal and angular gyri, indicating processes relating to mental imagery, or possibly mentalizing . 

Thus, in contrast to heterosexual participants, bisexual women showed greater activity towards male (relative to female) erotic pictures in affect-related brain areas. In this way, it seems that it would be overly simplistic to say that bisexual women are similar to heterosexual women, but with the addition of gynephilic interest. Rather,   bisexual women seem to have greater responses to both male and female erotic stimuli, depending on the brain area being considered  . Patterns of greater overall responsiveness are consistent with suggestions that bisexual women may be distinguished by having overall greater degrees of sexual motivation relative to heterosexual women . 

It is also notable that bisexual women uniquely showed greater activations to male stimuli in areas of the brain implicated in higher-order cognition, including mentalizing. Speculatively, these activations could be related to more complex processing of sexual motivation in bisexual women . To the degree that these activation patterns in bisexual women actually specifically reflect social cognition, the question remains open as to why this may be more likely to be observed in bisexual but not heterosexual or homosexual women. 

For homosexual women viewing erotic pictures, greater activations for female (relative to male) stimuli extended throughout the visual system, with additional clusters in occipitotemporal cortices. Clusters in the right inferior precuneus may have indicated mental imagery , and clusters in posterior parahippocampal cortex may have indicated either memory encoding or retrieval .   For homosexual women, no brain areas had significantly greater activation for male relative to female erotic pictures. Thus, homosexual women were the only group that exhibited an overall pattern of differential brain activity (between male and female sexual stimuli) greater only for pictures depicting their preferred gender  . 


### Whole brain responses to erotic videos 
  
For heterosexual women viewing erotic videos, activity was greater for female relative to male stimuli in bilateral superior temporal cortices likely indicating an auditory confound deriving from more extensive and substantial vocalizations being present in female erotic videos . Activity was greater for male relative to female videos in posterior occipital cortex, likely indicating enhanced visual attention . Further clusters (greater for male compared with female videos) in the inferolateral postcentral gyrus and parietal somatosensory association areas may have indicated awareness of bodily sensations, possibly related to sexual imagery . 

For bisexual women viewing erotic videos, activations were greater for female (relative to male) stimuli in superior temporal cortices, likely indicating the same auditory-related activity present in heterosexual women. Bisexual women’s brain activity was greater for male (relative to female) erotic videos in occipital cortex, likely indicating visual attention . Male-biased activations in somatosensory cortices may have indicated processing of bodily sensations , and further activations in bilateral superior parietal lobules, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, and right supramarginal gyrus may have indicated mental imagery or possibly mirroring with the actors shown in the videos . 

Similar to the findings for erotic pictures,   bisexual women were unique in the degree to which male videos produced activations in brain areas associated with more abstract (and possibly complex) processing  . Again, the significance of this pattern remains unclear. 

For homosexual women viewing female relative to male erotic videos, activity in superior temporal cortices likely indicated the same auditory-related processing observed in heterosexual and bisexual women, albeit more robustly and extensively, consistent with enhanced attention to emotionally salient stimulus features. When viewing male relative to female erotic videos, activations in the right somatosensory cortex may have indicated processing of bodily sensations , which may have been either positive or negative in valence. Thus, while emotionally associated brain areas did not exhibit differential activations for videos,   homosexual women’s particularly strong engagement of auditory cortices for female stimuli provided yet further evidence of uniquely gender-biased responding, relative to heterosexual and bisexual women  . 


### Comparisons with previous findings 
  
Few studies have investigated the category-specificity of brain activity in non-heterosexual women. Ponseti   et al  .  found that both heterosexual and homosexual women showed gender-specific patterns of brain activity in multiple areas, including the ventral striatum. Sylva   et al  .  also found some evidence for category-specific responding in women, although not in the ventral striatum, and without specifically testing whether or not heterosexual or homosexual women differed in their responses. 

The patterns observed Ponseti   et al  .  stand in contrast to the present investigation in which homosexual women tended to be the only group showing strongly category-specific responses to erotic stimuli. One possible interpretations for their findings of category-specific responses in all women was the unusual nature of the stimuli (i.e., close-up images of male and female genitalia, isolated from interpersonal contextual factors) . As suggested by Chivers (2017) , it may be the case that sex and gender cues can produce specific responses in heterosexual women, but that these are usually trumped by contextual factors in driving arousal responses in women. The stimuli utilized in the present study contained contextual factors (e.g. body posture, facial expression) that are more typical of those found in the genital arousal literature. 

However, it should be noted that the present study did not find support for greater category-specificity in homosexual women across all stimulus conditions. Rather, planned contrasts in the ventral striatum only revealed significant group differences between homosexual and non-homosexual women for erotic pictures. There were no significant differences in ventral striatum response between homosexual and non-homosexual women for erotic videos (even though subjective evaluations of those stimuli did significantly differ across the groups). 

This pattern of differing results for pictures versus videos may be related to differences in how individuals respond to these stimuli, limitations of our video paradigm, or both. While erotic videos may theoretically allow for the assessment of qualitatively different states of sexual response, it may be the case that incentive motivation is greatest when stimuli are first presented, but then diminishes with longer stimulus presentations . Additionally, erotic pictures may have been more effective at driving ventral striatum responses due to factors such as unpredictably varied presentation times of preferred stimuli contributing to larger magnitude reward-prediction errors . 


### Limitations 
  
One limitation of nearly all studies of erotic responses in women—including this one—is a failure to control for hormonal conditions or contraceptive usage. By default, it can generally be assumed that most women were not measured within the ovulatory window, when responses to erotic stimuli might be greatest . Additionally, a number of women may have been using hormonal contraceptives. Measuring women’s responses outside of the fertile phase of their cycles—or while they were using hormonal contraceptives —may have yielded a restricted range of arousal responses. However, the specificity of erotic responding has not been shown to be influenced by menstrual cycle in previous studies of genital arousal . 

Another source of potential limitations may have been the nature of the stimuli used. Though our stimuli were pilot-tested and rated by individuals of different sexual orientations in order to confirm that they would appeal to a broad participant sample, it is never possible to ensure that common stimuli will evoke the responses intended. This may be especially true for something as emotionally salient and individual as sexual arousal. Thus, it is possible that category specificity patterns could appear to be different if stimuli better reflected participants’ subjective preferences. This is a limitation of many studies of sexual responding, although data gleaned from more individualized stimulus sets are difficult to interpret. 

One more aspect of the stimuli that is difficult to control for is sensory details that are inherently different between male and female stimuli. Differences in actors’ vocalizations (for videos), actors’ body positions (for both videos and pictures), and actors’ body motions (in the videos) were present (on average) between male and female stimuli. These features are difficult to control for and could conceivably lead to differences in both subjective and neural responding when viewing male vs. female stimuli, especially in more primary sensory areas of the brain such as visual and auditory cortices. However, such differences may also serve to reinforce the gendered nature of the stimuli and improve their correspondence with real-world experiences and real-world arousal. 



## Conclusions 
  
Though the neural data presented here align with previously-observed patterns in women’s genital and subjective arousal, much remains unknown about the relationship between arousal patterns, orientation, and the development of sexual motivation towards particular sexes in women. Our study supports past findings indicating that women tend not to have strongly category-specific responses to erotic stimuli, with homosexual women showing somewhat greater specificity than heterosexual and bisexual women. Future research should explore the extent to which women’s non-specific sexual response contributes to erotic plasticity (i.e., change with context) and sexual fluidity (i.e., change over time) .

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> While this is an fMRI study of social processing in healthy adults (N=16, mean age 22.8) with an appropriate social task (judging facing-toward vs away; mirror and mentalizing system engagement), the primary statistical inference was conducted using a priori anatomical masks for the Mirror Neuron System and Mentalizing System. The authors state that the ANOVAs and post-hoc tests were performed within these two masks (“adopted as searching areas”), and reported results are restricted to those masked regions (small-volume/ROI-based inference). The review’s eligibility requires whole-brain results and excludes ROI-only analyses. Because the reported analyses are region-masked rather than unbiased whole-brain inference, the study does not meet the ‘whole-brain results’ inclusion criterion and must be excluded.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Processing biological motion is fundamental for everyday life activities, such as social interaction, motor learning and nonverbal communication. The ability to detect the nature of a motor pattern has been investigated by means of point-light displays (PLD), sets of moving light points reproducing human kinematics, easily recognizable as meaningful once in motion. Although PLD are rudimentary, the human brain can decipher their content including social intentions. Neuroimaging studies suggest that inferring the social meaning conveyed by PLD could rely on both the Mirror Neuron System (MNS) and the Mentalizing System (MS), but their specific role to this endeavor remains uncertain. We describe a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which participants had to judge whether visually presented PLD and videoclips of human-like walkers (HL) were facing towards or away from them. Results show that coding for stimulus direction specifically engages the MNS when considering PLD moving away from the observer, while the nature of the stimulus reveals a dissociation between MNS -mainly involved in coding for PLD- and MS, recruited by HL moving away. These results suggest that the contribution of the two systems can be modulated by the nature of the observed stimulus and its potential for social involvement.

## Introduction 
  
During social interactions, people engage in active social perception processes, such as attending to others’ body motion (BM), to evaluate the social situation. For instance, approach is associated with more positive evaluations than avoidance behavior, and a handshake preceding social interaction enhances the positive impact of approach and diminishes the negative impact of avoidance behavior on the evaluation of social interactions . As another example from everyday experience, we know that when someone has their back turned their social attitude is much reduced compared with when they are facing us. This social cue is not just unique to humans. The behaviour of animals is sensitive to whether another individual is present or not and also to whether that individual is or is not facing them, or looking at them . 

Despite its crucial role in guiding everyday social interactions, little is known about the social nature of BM signals and how our brain codes these signals. Here, we investigated how our brain reacts while observing a model approaching and moving away from the viewer. Furthermore we were interested in exploring whether the awareness of dealing with a biological rather than a non-biological agent can significantly change our attitude towards a possible social interaction. To this aim we compared Point-Light Displays (PLD)  with Human-Like stimuli (HL). PLD allow to represent kinematics of human movements by depicting activity via a few moving light points and to extract multiple aspects of social information including interactions with other people . For instance, Manera and colleagues  have investigated how well people can distinguish between different social intentions by observing a reach-to-grasp movement reproduced through PLD. The results show that PLD essential kinematic patterns were indeed sufficient to discriminate between individual and social intentions driving the action. 

Another study examined the link between perceived body orientation and motor simulation processes , using bistable PLD to assess the presence of any bias in the perception of stimulus direction (approaching/moving away). Results showed that the stimulus tended to be perceived as facing the viewer when participants were performing the same action (walking) as the PLD, suggesting that motor simulation mechanisms may be more salient when observed actions are directed towards the observer. Altogether, these findings emphasize the modulating effect of a potential social interaction assigned to PLD. 

Evidence coming from neuroimaging suggests that regions of the Mirror Neurons System (MNS)  are activated in response to point-light human motion . The MNS includes the ventral PreMotor Cortex (vPMC), the posterior Inferior Frontal Gyrus (pIFG), the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) and the rostral Inferior Parietal Lobule (rIPL)  and is characterized by a “mirror” mechanism in the sense that the same set of neurons is activated both when a person performs an action and when he/she observes another person performing the same action . The study of Saygin  measured brain activity while participants were observing PLD, matched scrambled biological motion and stationary point-light images, and showed that the observation of point-light biological motion activates regions of the frontal cortex, with particular reference to the premotor cortex, while the observation of scrambled biological motion does not. These findings suggest that the motor system of the observer may be recruited to “fill in” these simplified displays, in a manner similar to the way mirror neurons are activated in order to assist in action understanding. In a similar vein, Ulloa and Pineda  examined whether the recruitment of the MNS, as reflected in   mu   rhythm suppression, mediates recognition of point-light biological motion. Changes in   mu   power were recorded while participants viewed PLD, matched scrambled versions of PLD, and visual white-noise (baseline). The results revealed that PLD produced   mu   suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not, corroborating the hypothesis that the MNS is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input. 

Although an involvement of the MNS in the processing of PLD has been demonstrated, whether the MNS is sensitive to the potential for social involvement carried by such stimuli remains an open question. In this respect, some have advanced the hypothesis that the MNS works in concert with the Mentalizing System (MS), including regions along the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the precuneus (PreCU), the temporal pole (TP) and the posterior cingulated cortex  (PCC) in processing the social information conveyed by action kinematics . Becchio and colleagues  explored the role of visual kinematics in the implicit coding of intention by using functional brain imaging during the observation of grasping movements performed with social versus individual intents. The results showed stronger activation of the MNS and the MS during the observation of socially intended rather than individual movements. These findings demonstrate that, in the absence of context information, social information conveyed by action kinematics modulates intention processing: trying to read the reason why an action is performed in the absence of contextual information necessitates of a great deal of active inferencing, and the MNS may benefit from the additional recruitment of the MS . Both systems seem to favor intentions arising in the context of a social interaction as opposed to individual intentions . 

With this in mind the crucial questions are whether the processing of PLD by the MNS is confined to motor simulation as previously demonstrated , or it extends to the coding of the social involvement attached to such stimuli. And, if the latter is the case, does it work in concert with the MS? First, we hypothesize that if PLD stimuli are processed similarly to moving human like (HL), the MNS system should not distinguish between the two categories of stimuli. Alternatively, if the sparse information provided by PLD stimuli is more demanding to be coded than the coherent information provided by HL stimuli, then the MNS should be more activated for the former than for the latter stimuli. Although it has been demonstrated the involvement of the MNS in the processing of PLD stimuli, whether it is differently alerted by such stimuli in comparison to HL stimuli is still an open question. The very fact that for human displays PLD are not simply perceived as a pattern of unrelated lights is not a trivial computational problem. For instance, whereas for fixed rigid structures like a box there is only one structure that could fit the available array of moving lights, for human displays there are many rigid structures that could account for the spatial relationships between the moving lights . The increase in computational demands may call for an heavier recruitment of ‘mirror’ activity. 

The potential for social involvement conveyed by both PLD and HL stimuli was manipulated, by presenting PLD and HL stimuli moving towards the observer (Facing Towards, FT) or away from her/him (Facing Away, FA). We hypothesize that the potential for social involvement perceived by the observer while watching moving stimuli approaching her/him or walking away could have the ability to modulate the contribution of the MNS and the MS in the processing of PLD and HL stimuli. Specifically, we hypothesized that the activity of the MNS would be enhanced by the observation of stimuli moving towards the observer given  the preferred processing of social stimuli characterizing the MNS and its potential role in encoding potential for social involvement . 

To test these hypotheses, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to determine the response of the MNS and the MS to different combinations of stimuli and moving directions. The patterns of response  have been explored by means of two separated analyses, focusing namely on MSN and MS brain regions. Overall, the results show that while the MS is massively recruited during the observation of HL stimuli only when the stimulus is moving towards the observer, the MNS appears to be more engaged during the observation of PLD, and to be selectively influenced by the direction of the movement. 


## Results 
  
To verify how the MS and the MNS contribute to BM processing, images of bistable PLD were presented while participants were laying in a scanner for Magnetic Resonance (MR), and were asked to judge whether the stimulus was a FT or a FA type by pressing one of two keys on a response device. HL videos were also presented, characterized by the same movement parameters as PLD. Bistability of stimuli was checked with a one-sample t-test comparing the expected (0.50 FA and 0.50 FT) and observed distribution of responses. The results confirmed the absence of any bias for giving either FA (t  = −0.387, p = 0.704, mean = 0.491, 95% C.I. = 0.441 − 0.541), or FT (t  = 0.387, p = 0.704, mean = 0.509, 95% C.I. = 0.459 − 0.559) responses. Comparisons between conditions were conducted on fMRI data in order to examine how the MNS and the MS responded to stimuli characterized by different biological features (PLD and HL) with a different potential for a social interaction (FT and FA). Statistical details of the results and stereotaxic coordinates of BOLD peaks are reported in Table  .

### Main effect of movement direction (FT vs FA) 
  
When comparing activity related to movement direction (FT vs FA) independently from the type of stimulus (PLD vs HL), no significant effects were observed within the MS system. Concerning the MNS circuit, significant differences were observed in the inferior sector of the left parietal region (IPL) for the comparison FA > FT. 


### Main effect of type of stimulus (PLD vs HL) 
  
The contrast testing for differences between PLD and HL stimuli independently from their movement direction revealed significant effects within both the MS and the MNS systems. Concerning the MS system, the contrast PLD > HL highlighted significant differential activity in the right mPFC. Although in a more dorsomedial region, also the opposite contrast (HL > PLD) was associated with significant effects in the mPFC bilaterally, together with the bilateral AG and the right PCU. For the MNS circuit the comparison PLD > HL highlighted significant differences in the IPL bilaterally, and within the right IFG. The opposite contrast, HL > PLD, highlighted significant differences in the left hemisphere, within the IPL and the IFG. 


### Interaction between movement direction and type of stimulus 
  
The interaction between the type of stimulus (PLD vs HL) and its movement direction (FT vs FA) revealed significant differential activity within both the MS and the MNS. Concerning the MS the right mPFC appeared to be sensitive to the different combinations of movement direction and type of stimulus, as well as the left IFG and IPL belonging to the MNS. Significant effects were explored by conducting post-hoc contrasts (paired   t  -tests) testing for differences between single conditions within the aforementioned brain locations (see Table  ). This procedure highlighted that the right mPFC was significantly more involved by HL rather than PLD stimuli, but only in the FA condition (see Table   and Fig.  ). When considering the MNS, both the left IFG and the left IPL were significantly more involved while watching PLD rather than HL, but only when the stimuli were moving away from the observer (FA). In addition, both regions appeared to be more engaged during the observation of FA with respect to FT stimuli, but only for PLD stimuli. No further significant differences emerged within the considered regions.

## Discussion 
  
The experiment consisted of short videoclips representing either bistable PLD or videos of human walkers (HL) moving towards or away from the observer. While observing such stimuli, participants were requested to judge whether they were moving towards or away from them by pressing a key on a response device. Results showed a significant modulation of BOLD signal within the network of areas belonging to both the MNS and the MS, revealing different patterns of response according to the different combinations of type of stimulus and moving direction, suggesting that MNS and MS systems are differentially activated by PLD and HL stimuli. Furthermore, only the MNS appears to be modulated by stimulus direction, which directly flows into a key question at the roots of the present investigation, that is whether the MNS is concerned with the processing of social cues conveyed by PLD stimuli. 

Saygin and colleagues  suggest that the observation of point-light biological motion recruits significantly stronger activity in the frontal region in respect to scrambled movement. Along the same line, Ulloa and Pineda  revealed that point-light biological motion engages the MNS as reflected in   mu   rhythm suppression observed in response to biological but not scrambled motion. Overall, it seems that the motor system of the observer may be recruited to “fill in” these simplified displays, in a manner similar to the way mirror neurons are activated in order to assist in action understanding. Our results not only confirm that the MNS is recruited during the observation of PLD, but also that it is sensitive to the moving direction of the observed stimulus. Its contribution becomes evident when considering a stimulus moving away from the observer (FA condition), but not when the stimulus faces the observer (FT condition). These findings support the hypothesis that the mirror mechanism could play a crucial role in mediating the process of integrating sparse motion cues into a complete human action. In other words, brain regions, whose role in social interaction has been widely explored and testified , seem to play a major role when the potential for a social involvement has to be inferred. As outlined in previous work , we are more used to interact with other individuals in a face-to-face rather than a face-to-back situation. In the latter case ascribing to a stimulus the potential for social involvement might be more demanding and might require additional ‘efforts’ by the MNS to ‘socially’ interpret ambiguous social cues (as those provided by PLD in the FA condition) rather than coding more evident social cues (as those provided by HL stimuli in the FT condition). In this perspective, the MNS seems to carry the additional processing weight for stimulus interpretation, confirming its role in action understanding . This finding could be explained also by a strong tendency to interpret stimuli representing a walker moving as facing the viewer even when they are not . Several factors could be responsible for this perceptual bias. For example, high-level cognitive factors, as suggested by Klopfer , or stored motion patterns (‘sprites’ ). In these accounts familiarity is a key factor, and it is assumed that observers are confronted visually more often with frontal than with back views of their conspecifics. The biological and/or the potential for social interaction linked to frontal views might also be at the heart of the phenomenon. Even if the present study does not allow us to make definite claims as to the source of this tendency, the literature indicates that observers tend to interpret an upright walker presented in different views as approaching . 

The key role of MNS in coding for PLD stimuli becomes evident also when comparing PLD to HL in FA condition: the representation of an entity walking away from the observer provided by moving point lights involves the MNS more than a HL moving in the same direction. This finding adds to a rather slim literature looking at the possible role of the MNS as a filtering mechanism for social kind of information and suggests that activity of the MNS is dependent upon whether the agent is facing towards or away from the observer . 

The contribution of the MNS is not only confined to the processing of PLD stimuli, but it emerges also for HL stimuli when considering movement direction. The MNS is significantly more recruited in the FT rather than in the FA condition. At first sight, this result may contrast with the finding that, for PLD stimuli, activity within the MNS is greater for the FA than for the FT condition. However, the fact that the contribution of the MNS becomes significant when the HL stimulus approaches the observer, presumably reflects the coding of social aspects provided by a context in which a clear cue indicating the potential for social interaction is presented . In other words, the idea that activations within the MNS are enhanced when watching a scene with a potential for social interactions appears to be confirmed . 

The contribution of the MS appears to be significant when comparing HL and PLD stimuli moving away from the observer. This pattern of results supports the idea that mentalizing regions contribute to analyze other people’s actions when the viewer decides to reflect upon their goals and intentions . It seems that, although PLD convey surprisingly detailed information about movements of the human body, they might be too simplified to require a concrete involvement by the MS. In this perspective, the recruitment of MS regions during the observation of moving biological stimuli (TPJ, mPFC, PCU) is coherent with the results obtained by a variety of mentalizing tasks such as the attribution of goals, intentions and the monitoring other-executed actions . We also know from our everyday experience that when someone has his/her back turned the potential for a social interaction in such situation is much reduced compared with a situation of facing someone. Therefore, we suggest that the pattern of activity within the MS in the forward facing might reflect a process modulated by the social intention ascribed to the person being observed. Because reflecting on the intention of an agent performing an action necessarily involves the processing of what s/he is doing and how s/he is doing it, activation within MS varies as a function of intention-related information conveyed by the observed action . 


## Conclusion 
  
The perception of point-light stimuli remains an impressive achievement of our visual system. The ambiguous PLD might provide a valuable new window on the issue whether the perception of human action is ‘special’, in the sense that actions are processed in a qualitatively unique way and whether this functional specialization is supported by a specific architecture hard-wired in the brain. The present results demonstrate that the recruitment of the MNS is crucial in coding PLD but only when considering stimuli moving away from the observer. This confirms the crucial role of the MNS in the processing of abstract visual representations of actions defined by motion cues alone. Observing HL, instead, seems to elicit an involvement of the MS, with a less pronounced contribution of the MNS suggesting a specific role of the MS in coding for the social meaning conveyed by human-like moving stimuli. In this view the mirror and the mentalizing systems are portrayed as sensitive to different aspects of social involvement, playing specific roles depending on the nature of the observed stimulus. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Sixteen participants took part in the experiment (10 female, mean age 22,75 years, SD 2,9). They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no neurologic or psychiatric history, and were not under medical treatment with drugs potentially interfering with cerebral blood flow and/or brain metabolism. Before entering the scanner all participants underwent MR safety screening and gave their written consent to the MR scanning procedure. Information concerning experiment aims and confidentiality criteria for personal and MR data treatment was also provided, and participants were required to give their consent to take part in their study and to allow the experimenter to use their data for scientific dissemination (e.g., scientific articles). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Experimentation of the University of Padova (CESC - Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Clinica, University of Padova). All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. 


### Stimuli and task 
  
Stimuli consisted of PLD of a walking person with 13 markers indicating the head and the center of the major joints of a person (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and feet; see Fig.  ). All PLD were derived from the stimulus set of Vanrie and Verfaillie , consisting of 3D-coordinates of a human actions walker of which the translational component was removed . As a result, the walker moved as if walking on a treadmill, in the center of the screen. The visual angle between the points attached to the head and the feet was about 5.7 deg. Each dot subtended about 0.14 deg. Each stimulus presentation lasted 2.885 s consisting of two walking cycles, each consisting of two steps. The starting posture in the walking cycle was randomized across trials. Stimuli were black against a grey background, and were administered using Presentation software (14.4 version, Neurobehavioral Systems) on a 15.4-inch monitor (VisuaStim XGA, Resonance Technology Inc., display resolution: 1280 × 800; refresh rate: 60 Hz). In order to obtain stimuli with different degrees of ambiguity in respect to their orientation (FT vs. FA), the in-depth orientation of the point-light figures was manipulated by introducing perspective cues, including modifications of shape, size, and position of the dots as a result of a perspective projection . Levels of perspective manipulation (corresponding to 30%, 50%, and 70% FT responses) were determined individually for each participant during a preliminary adjustment task (see below). This means that, for each participant, we employed PLD   subjectively   ambiguous in respect to their orientation. HL stimuli were characterized by the same movement parameters as the PLD (see Fig.  ). For HL stimuli, six unique video-clips (three FT and three FA videos) were recorded form three ‘actors’ with minor physical differences (e.g., haircut or wearing details). Actors were positioned at the center of a corridor and then asked to walk either towards the video camera positioned in front of them (FT), or in the opposite direction (FA). Video-clips were then edited using Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 (.wmv format, disabled audio, 25 frames/s) in order to produce stimuli in which the actors moved as if walking on a treadmill, in the center of a gray background. Once the video-clip was edited, a ‘human-like’ digital actor was clearly recognizable but without allowing for the identification of the ‘original’ actor.   
The central panel depicts bistable point-light displays (PLD) and the two possible ways to interpret its motion direction: Facing The viewer (FT) on the left, and Facing Away (FA) on the right. 
  


### Preliminary Adjustment Task 
  
Despite the absence of differentiating visual cues, when presented with an orthographic projection of a PLD, observers tend to show a tendency to interpret the stimulus as facing towards them . To obtain subjectively ad-hoc bistable stimuli, before scanning the point of subjective ambiguity  (PSA) was determined for each participant. PSA falls when a stimulus with a specific degree of perspective manipulation is interpreted by a specific individual 50% of times as FT and 50% of times as FA. According to Schouten and Verfaillie , the perspective cues carrying the information concerning the veridical orientation of the point-light walker were gradually manipulated across different levels (nine), from moderately FT to strongly FA. The nine levels of perspective information included one orthographic projection (neutral) and eight distance manipulations of the convergence point, corresponding to −4, −8, −16, 16, 8, 6, 4, and 2 times the height of the walker (negative values indicate FT stimuli). This resulted respectively in field of view angles of −53°, −28°, −14°, 14°, 28°, 37°, 53°, and 90°. 

On each trial, participants were asked to indicate whether the visually presented stimulus was perceived as oriented towards or away from them by pressing one of two buttons of a response box (the button below the index finger for FT and the button below the middle finger for FA responses). Participants were instructed to respond according to their own subjective experience and it was stressed that an equal distribution of both response alternatives was not necessary. In total, each participant completed 270 trials (9 perspective levels * 30 repetitions). Individual perspective levels were determined by fitting a cumulative Gaussian function to the proportion of FT responses and selecting the 30%, 50% (PSA), and 70% thresholds. The lowest and highest perspective manipulations allowed were −1 (−127 degrees) and 1 (127 degrees). 


### Experimental design 
  
The whole experimental session consisted in 6 functional runs where the type of moving stimulus (PLD vs HL) was blocked across runs, with a total of 3 runs for each condition (6 runs in all). Runs belonging to the same type of stimulus were presented consecutively (PLD, PLD, PLD, HL, HL, HL or HL, HL, HL, PLD, PLD, PLD), counterbalancing the sequence across participants. 135 trials per condition were administered with an event related design, for a total of 270 trials. Concerning PLD stimuli the trials were equally divided into FA, and FT (45 trials per each individual perspective threshold). The 135 HL stimuli were also divided into 67 or 68 FA and 67 or 68 FT trials depending on the participant… Each trial started with the presentation of the moving stimulus (2885 ms). Then participants laying in the MR scanner were instructed to decide whether the visually presented stimulus was oriented towards or away from them. A screen informed the participant about the key associated with the response. The Italian word ‘di fronte’ (FT) on the left prompted a button press of a MR compatible response box with the index finger, while the word ‘di spalle’ (FA) on the right prompted a button press with the middle finger. Participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible while keeping the number of errors low. This screen was presented for at most 3000 ms, or until response. It was then followed by an interstimulus interval (black fixation cross) with a duration varying from 1 to 6 seconds, distributed according to a ‘long exponential’ probability distribution  and randomized across trials. 


### fMRI data acquisition 
  
Data were acquired with a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto MR scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a standard eight channels coils. Participants were positioned headfirst and supine in the magnet bore. The head was held in place with clamps to avoid head motion. Functional images were acquired with a gradient-echo, Echo-Planar (EPI) T2*-weighted sequence in order to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent signal (BOLD) throughout the whole brain (37 contiguous axial slices, ascending interleaved sequence, 56 × 64 voxels, 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm × 4.0 mm resolution, FOV = 196 mm × 224 mm, flip angle = 90°, TE = 49 ms). Volumes were acquired continuously for each run with a repetition time (TR) of 3 s; 134 volumes were collected in each single scanning run, resulting in 6 functional runs of 6 min and 42 s each. High-resolution anatomical images were acquired for each participant using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence (176 axial slices, no interslice gap, data matrix 256 × 256, 1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.91 ms, flip angle = 15°). 


### fMRI data preprocessing 
  
Data preprocessing was performed by combining Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM -   http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ), FMRIB Software Library (FSL -   https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl  ) and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs -   http://stnava.github.io/ANTs  ). Functional images were motion corrected with FSL, by aligning each volume to the median one in each session using an affine transformation. The six median volumes were also used to create a template by using the buildtemplateparallel script in ANTs , which also returned the linear transformations from each single median volume to the template. A linear transformation was calculated from the template to the T1 image using the Boundary-Based Registration  (BBR) implemented in FSL. The motion corrected EPI images were normalized to the MNI152 space in a single step by concatenating the three transformations (EPI ->EPI-template, EPI-template ->T1, T1 - >MNI152). The normalized EPI images were then spatially smoothed with SPM12 with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm  FWHM (number of resels: 38 for MNS, 35 for MS), and temporally filtered with a high-pass filter with a frequency cut-off of 1/128 Hz. Finally, FSL was adopted to detect the timepoints in the fMRI series that were corrupted by large motion. Structural T1 images were initially corrected for bias field inhomogeneities using the N4 algorithm  and subsequently segmented in Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF), WM and GM images. Then a transformation from T1 to MNI152 (1 mm  isovoxel) was calculated using a non-linear diffeomorphic deformation. All these steps were performed using ANTs . 


### fMRI data analyses 
  
fMRI data analysis of time series was performed with SPM12. BOLD signal was first analyzed at the individual level: for each participant, separate regressors were defined based on the timing of presentation of each of the four experimental conditions (PLD_FT, PLD_FA, HL_FT, HL_FA), and these functions were convolved with a canonical, synthetic hemodynamic response function (HRF). Each trial was modelled as a 2.885 s duration event, starting at the onset of the video. The time window devoted to question presentation regarding movement direction (3000 ms or until response) was modeled as regressor of no interest, as well as head motion parameters (6) calculated during the realignment stage, and eventual additional matrices controlling for nuisance introduced by corrupted volumes. Finally, stimuli classified as FT or FA on the basis of the individual preliminary adjustment task but receiving a different response during the proper experiment were labeled as ‘errors’ and modeled as additional regressors. For each participant, all regressors were incorporated into a General Linear Model  (GLM). Individual models were separately estimated and contrasts were defined in order to pick out the main effects of each experimental condition. At the second level, contrasts for the main effect of type of movement direction (FT or FA) and the video type (PLD or HL) were obtained for the whole brain. Since the study aimed at describing the response of the MNS and the MS to our experimental manipulation, two ANOVAs were conducted, considering different sets of brain regions. Two different masks were built: for the MNS the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, pars opercularis and triangularis), the Inferior Parietal Cortex (IPC) and the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) were considered (see Fig.  ). For the MS circuit the Precuneus (PCU), the medial PreFrontal Cortex (mPFC) and the Temporo-Parietal Junction (TPJ) were included (see Fig.  ). Concerning TPJ, its more posterior sector was considered, corresponding to the Angular Gyrus (AG): recent work has underlined that activations related to social cognition mainly fall in this region . Functional resting state connectivity between the AG and other MS regions such as mPFC and PCC has also been described . The Wake Forest University brain atlas (  http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas  ) was used to create both MNS and MS masks. These two masks were adopted as searching areas in the analysis of variance and the subsequent post-hoc analysis, considering movement direction (FT vs FA) and type of stimulus (PLD vs HL) as within-subject variables. Results obtained through this masking procedure were thresholded at p < 0.05 (FWE corrected for multiple comparisons) at both the cluster and peak levels (cluster extent of ≥30 voxels).
