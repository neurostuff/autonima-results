      "reason": "This study reports task-based functional MRI in healthy adult participants (Experiments 1 and 2; ages 18\u201341 and 18\u201333). The task contrasts vocal (socially relevant) versus non-vocal sounds and explicitly frames vocal processing as social communication/perception. Group-level, whole-brain voxelwise activation maps and contrasts (vocal > non-vocal and related analyses) are reported with statistical thresholds (FDR-corrected voxelwise maps and cluster thresholds). Whole-brain task-evoked results are clearly described for the healthy/control sample. Therefore the paper meets criteria for fMRI social-related task, healthy adult sample, and whole-brain group-level reporting.",

The sample includes a clearly reported neurotypical healthy adult group (matched controls, ages within 18\u201365) with results presented separately from the ASD group (I4). The paper reports group-level whole-brain task activation results (univariate contrasts and accompanying figures/tables of activated brain areas and MNI coordinates for the control/NT group; see Additional file 1: Figure S2 and Table S2), satisfying the requirement for whole-brain voxelwise maps (I5). Reporting of whole-brain results in figures/tables meets the acceptability clause (I6). No exclusion criteria apply.",

      "reason": "This is an empirical fMRI study examining how collective (social) schemas influence memory, implicating social-cognition-related medial prefrontal regions (dmPFC/vmPFC). The task involved retrieval of museum images with emphasis on collective/social meaning, and analyses tested social/collective representations. The sample consisted of healthy adults (N=24; ages 22\u201339). The paper reports group-level whole-brain searchlight results (TFCE-corrected) and ROI analyses; whole-brain task-evoked maps and cluster results are clearly described.
