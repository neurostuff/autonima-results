<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social-related processing (agency attribution/theory-of-mind using Heider-&-Simmel style animations). Participants are healthy adults (n=12, mean age ~25), within 17–65. The paper reports group-level, random-effects, whole-brain voxelwise task contrasts (High>Low and Low>High intentionality) analyzed in SPM2 with reported activation loci (STS, IFG, occipital regions, etc.) and statistical thresholds (p<0.001 uncorrected). Whole-brain results are described in the text and shown in figures/tables. No exclusion criteria apply (not ROI-only, not connectivity-only, includes healthy adult whole-brain task activation). Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study used task-based fMRI during observation of socio-affective (social touch) videos, a social-related paradigm. It includes a clearly reported healthy control group of neurotypical adults (n=21, ages within adult range). The paper reports group-level univariate whole-brain task contrasts and associated activation results for the control/NT group (mean group effects and coordinate tables shown in the main text and supplementary materials, e.g., Figure S2 and Table S2). Analyses are not limited to ROI or connectivity only. Therefore all inclusion criteria are met for inclusion in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies of social processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an event-related fMRI study of persuasion/‘expert power’, clearly social cognition (perception/understanding of others, social influence). Participants are healthy adults (young females, n=24 with group analyses on 18/16 after exclusions) within the 17–65 range. The paper reports group-level, univariate, whole-brain task-evoked contrasts (SME, SAE, expertise main effects and interactions) with cluster correction and tables/figures of activations (including whole-brain maps and coordinate tables); ROI small-volume corrections are additionally reported but do not replace whole-brain results. The study is empirical with original fMRI data and healthy-group results generalizable to adults. No exclusion criteria are violated. Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study meets all inclusion criteria: (1) It uses task-based fMRI during a social-related paradigm (dynamic virtual-reality direct vs averted gaze assessing social cognition/mentalizing). (2) The sample includes a healthy adult control group (n=16; mean age ~30.6), and control-group results are reported separately. (3) The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task-evoked analyses for the control group (full-factorial and within-group contrasts; whole-brain activation tables and figures are provided showing DMPFC, TPJ, temporal pole, etc.). The manuscript also provides ROI analyses, but these do not preclude inclusion because whole-brain control results are clearly reported. No exclusion criteria are violated. Therefore, include this study in the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This fMRI study used a social-related task (dynamic happy and fearful facial expression processing), which fits social perception/understanding of others. The sample includes a healthy control group of young adults (mean age ~22, within 17–65). The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task-evoked statistical maps and contrasts for both the familial risk (FR) and control groups (thresholded Z>2.3, cluster-corrected p=0.05), with figures and tables showing control-group activation/deactivation clusters. Although a familial-risk group is included, results for the healthy control group are reported separately and are generalizable to healthy adults. The study also includes ROI and PPI analyses, but these are supplementary to the whole-brain task maps. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria and does not violate exclusion criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study used task-based fMRI during a social decision-making paradigm (the ultimatum game) in healthy adult participants (male, ages 23–28). It reports group-level whole-brain analyses: an offline cross-subject whole-brain SVM classification with voxelwise weight maps and permutation-derived p-values (discriminating volumes reported, e.g., bilateral LPFC, occipital cortex, AI/right AI, vmPFC, ventral striatum, OFC, pSTS). These results constitute group-level, voxelwise evidence generalizable across healthy subjects (leave-one-subject-out cross-validation and reported discriminative volumes/p-values). The study is not ROI-only, not resting-state or connectivity-only, and includes healthy adults within the required age range. Therefore it meets the inclusion criteria for fMRI studies of social processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social-emotional processing (schadenfreude vs fremdscham) in healthy adult participants (N=34; ages 19–31 and 22–29), within the 17–65 range. The task is social-related (observing others’ social integrity threats) and evoked task-related BOLD responses. The paper reports group-level, voxelwise whole-brain contrasts (SIT vs NEUT) with family-wise error correction and tables/figures of activations, satisfying the whole-brain evidence requirement. Although some ROI analyses and connectivity analyses are included, whole-brain univariate task effects for the healthy/control group are clearly reported. The sample consists of healthy males only (not an exclusion), and results for the healthy group are presented. Therefore all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria (ROI-only, resting-state only, patient-only, or inappropriate age range) are violated.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social processing (gaze perception/ToM). It includes a healthy adult control group (typical male participants) and reports within-group task contrasts for controls (e.g., controls: direct gaze > averted gaze) with coordinates and statistical results. Whole-brain voxelwise contrasts are referenced (faces vs. null was FWE-corrected at the whole-brain level and used to define visual/motor ROIs), and results are presented as group-level univariate contrasts (tables/figures) rather than only seed/ROI or connectivity-only analyses. Therefore it meets: (1) social-related fMRI task, (2) healthy adult sample with separable control-group results, and (3) group-level univariate whole-brain task-evoked results reported. No exclusion criteria (ROI-only, connectivity-only, or non-empirical) apply. Confident inclusion for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical fMRI study in healthy adults that used a social task (viewing faces of real-world social network members) probing social cognition and valuation. The sample consists of community/college adult participants (within 17–65). The paper reports group-level task-evoked neural activity in affective valuation and social-cognition systems using whole-brain analyses (not limited to ROI-only or resting-state/ connectivity-only approaches) and describes results generalizable to the healthy group. Independent functional localizers and whole-brain contrasts/coordinates are reported in the main text and supporting information. No exclusion criteria are violated (not an ROI-only, connectivity-only, between-group-only, non-empirical, or out-of-range sample). Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria for whole-brain univariate task fMRI studies of social processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Background 
  
The neuropeptide oxytocin can extensively modulate human social behavior and affective processing, and its effects can be interpreted in terms of mediating approach-avoidance motivational processes. However, little is known about how oxytocin mediates approach-avoidance behavior and particularly the underlying neural mechanisms. 


## Methods 
  
In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject design, the present pharmaco-fMRI study used an approach-avoidance paradigm to investigate oxytocin’s effects on approach-avoidance behavior and associated neural mechanisms. 


## Results 
  
Results revealed that oxytocin generally decreased activity in the right striatum irrespective of response (approach/avoidance) and social context, suggesting an inhibitory effect on motivational representation during both appetitive approach and aversive avoidance. Importantly, while on the behavioral level oxytocin selectively enhanced accuracy when approaching social positive stimuli, on the neural level it decreased left ventral and right dorsal anterior insula activity in response to social vs nonsocial positive stimuli compared with the placebo treatment. The left ventral anterior insula activity was negatively correlated with the corresponding accuracy difference scores in the oxytocin but not in the placebo group. 


## Conclusion 
  
Given the role of the ventral anterior insula in emotional processing and the dorsal anterior insula in salience processing, the oxytocin-induced suppression of activity in these regions may indicate that oxytocin is acting to reduce interference from hyper-activity in core regions of the emotional and salience networks when approaching salient positive social stimuli and thereby to promote social interaction. Thus, oxytocin may be of potential therapeutic benefit for psychiatric disorders exhibiting avoidance of social stimuli.

## Significance Statement 
  
The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in modulating human social behavior. These effects can be interpreted in terms of OT’s actions on basal approach-avoidance (AA) motivational processes, as proposed by the general AA hypothesis of OT (GAAO). However, few studies have evaluated the proposed OT effects on AA behavior and particularly the underlying neural mechanisms. Using neuroimaging combined with intranasal OT administration, the present study revealed that while OT selectively enhanced behavioral accuracy when approaching social positive stimuli, it decreased left ventral and right dorsal anterior insula (AI) activity in response to social vs nonsocial positive stimuli compared to the PLC treatment, with the left ventral AI activity being negatively correlated with the corresponding behavioral accuracy only in the OT group. These findings provide the first confirmatory evidence for the GAAO by demonstrating that OT facilitates human approach behavior to social positive stimuli via inhibiting AI activity. 

 
## Introduction 
  
Across species, the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) regulates social behavior, particularly bonding and maternal care ( ;  ). During the last 2 decades, the number of studies examining oxytocinergic regulation of human behavior via intranasal administration of OT has steadily increased. While OT can facilitate appetitive approach behaviors, such as interpersonal trust and generosity ( ;  ), pair bonding and maternal behavior ( ;  ) and emotional empathy and face recognition ( ;  ), it can also promote aversive avoidance behavior by increasing envy and schadenfreude ( ), ethnocentrism (e.g., trust and empathy;  ;  ), group-serving dishonesty ( ), and noncooperation ( ;  ). 

To account for these complex and somewhat contradictory findings,   proposed in their general approach-avoidance (AA) hypothesis of OT (GAAO) that the broad effects of OT on human behavior are mediated by its actions on basal AA motivational processes. More specifically, within this extended overarching framework, OT’s complex behavioral effects are considered to be rooted in its modulation of the salience of personally relevant and emotionally evocative stimuli not necessarily restricted to social contexts ( ; cf.   for the social-approach/withdrawal hypothesis and   for the social salience hypothesis). However, surprisingly few studies have experimentally evaluated the proposed effects of OT on AA behavior and particularly the underlying neural mechanisms. 

In a previous study that examined the effects of intranasal OT on human AA behavior, OT was found to accelerate both approach and avoidance behavior towards emotionally negative stimuli such as disgusted faces ( ;  ). Using similar paradigms, OT also facilitated approach towards angry faces with a direct gaze ( ). Furthermore, in the context of pair bonding, OT was found to modulate interpersonal space by decreasing the preferred distance men in a romantic relationship kept between themselves and an unknown attractive woman ( ). However, these studies predominantly used emotional faces to investigate OT’s actions on AA behavior and were thus unable to determine whether observed effects were driven by its well-established actions on increased attention and attraction to faces per se ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, the neural substrates mediating OT’s effects on AA behavior also remain unclear, with initial evidence showing decreased amygdala activity only when approaching angry faces ( ). Since this latter study also used facial stimuli, this again precludes any definitive conclusion as to whether findings simply reflect the well-documented anxiolytic effect of OT in decreasing amygdala responses to threatening facial expressions ( ;  ) rather than specific effects on AA behavior. 

The present study has therefore employed a face-independent AA task combined with fMRI to investigate OT’s specific effects on AA behavior and the underlying neural mechanisms involved. Thus, social and nonsocial scenes rather than facial experimental stimuli were used to determine specific effects of OT on AA behavior per se to avoid its potential confounding effects on face processing. Participants were instructed to approach positive (appetitive approach) and avoid negative (aversive avoidance) stimuli during the AA task. In accordance with the GAAO that OT modulates salience of cues that are personally relevant and emotionally evocative but not necessarily specific to social contexts ( ), we hypothesized that OT would (1) facilitate approach behavior to positive stimuli, particularly more emotionally evocative social ones, and associated activity in the motivational and emotional salience core regions such as the striatum and anterior insula, and (2) decrease avoidance behavior via attenuating amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli, particularly more emotionally evocative negative social ones. 


## Methods And Materials 
  
### Participants and Treatment 
  
A total of 83 healthy male students (mean age=21.35 years, SD=2.48) participated in a randomized, double-blind, between-subject experiment and were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal OT (40 IU; Oxytocin Spray, Sichuan Meike Pharmacy Co. Ltd, China) or placebo (PLC; same ingredients other than OT, i.e., sodium chloride and glycerin). To control for potential confounding effects from personality traits or mood states, subjects completed Chinese versions of validated psychometric questionnaires before treatment, including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( ), Autism Spectrum Quotient ( ), Empathy Quotient ( ), and NEO 5-factor inventory ( ). To further control for a potentially confounding influence of altered mood states, subjects were asked to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 3 times: after they first arrived (pretreatment), before MRI scanning (posttreatment), and finally after scanning (post-scan). Subjects received OT/PLC treatment in accordance with a standardized protocol ( ), and fMRI acquisition started 45 minutes after treatment. A total of 7 subjects were excluded due to technical issues during data acquisition (4 subjects) or excessive head movement (3 subjects). Thus, 39 subjects in the OT group and 37 subjects in the PLC group were included in the final analysis. In postscan interviews, subjects were unable to identify better than chance whether they had received OT or PLC (χ =0.21,   P  =.646). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before study inclusion. All procedures were in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethical committee of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 


### The AA Task 
  
In a revised AA task ( ), participants were instructed to make approach responses to positive social or nonsocial stimuli (e.g., happy friends meeting or beautiful landscapes) and avoidance responses to social or nonsocial negative stimuli (e.g., victims or environmental pollution). In a prestudy, we selected 620 pictures mostly from the International Affective Picture System ( ) and additionally from the Internet that were rated in terms of valence and arousal (9-point Likert scale) by an independent sample of 34 healthy volunteers (18 males). Based on this data, a total of 112 stimuli (28 pictures per category, positive vs negative and social vs nonsocial) were selected: social positive (valence: mean±SD=2.36±0.27; arousal: 6.27±0.35), social negative (valence: 2.47±0.26; arousal: 6.65±0.46), nonsocial positive (valence: 1.68±0.39; arousal: 6.25±0.42), and nonsocial negative (valence: 1.87±0.55; arousal: 6.10±0.70). Note that the valence rating scores were transformed to the distance from the neutral midpoint of the 9-point scale. Each picture was presented for 3 seconds at a 624- × 468-pixel resolution followed by a jittered inter-stimulus interval of 2 to 6 seconds. Subjects were instructed to pull the positive stimuli towards their body by pressing the “down” key and push the negative stimuli away from their body by pressing the “up” key successively via a response pad during the 3-second presentation. To realistically convey approach and avoidance of the stimuli for the subjects, each pulling-associated button press would enlarge the picture by 100×75 pixels while each pushing response would decrease the size of the picture by 100×75 pixels. All subjects preformed 10 practice trials before entering the scanner and were instructed to respond as fast and accurately as possible during the experiment. 


### Image Acquisition and Data Analysis 
  
Images were collected using a 3 Tesla, GE Discovery MR750 system (General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI). During each fMRI scan, a time series of volumes was acquired using a T2*-weighted echo-planar pulse sequence (repetition time: 2000 ms; echo time: 30 ms; number of slices: 39; slice thickness: 4 mm; gap: 1 mm; field of view: 240×240 mm; resolution: 64×64; flip angle: 90°). To control for any anatomic abnormalities and increase normalization accuracy during preprocessing, additional T1-weighted images were acquired obliquely with a 3-dimensional spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence (repetition time: 6 milliseconds; echo time: 2 milliseconds; flip angle: 9°; field of view: 256×256 mm; acquisition matrix: 256×256; number of slices: 156; slice thickness: 1 mm). 

Images were processed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London;   https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/  ) ( ). The first 5 functional images were deleted to achieve magnet-steady images, and the remaining images were realigned to correct for head movement based on a 6-parameter rigid body algorithm. After co-registering the mean functional image and the T1 image, the T1 image was segmented to determine the parameters for normalizing the functional images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. These normalized images were finally spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (8 mm full-width at half maximum). 

The first-level design matrix included 4 condition-specific regressors (social positive/negative, nonsocial positive/negative) convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and the 6 head-motion parameters as nuisance regressors. Contrast images for each stimulus condition, all positive and all negative were created separately. On the second level, group differences were analyzed using 2-sample   t   tests. Interactions were tested using an ANOVA model implemented in a flexible factorial design. Based on our region-specific hypotheses, the analysis focused on core regions involved in salience processing ( ;  ) and appetitive/approach (social/nonsocial reward) and withdrawal/avoidance (punishment/threat) motivational processes ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ), that is, the amygdala, the AI, and the striatum. Importantly, these regions strongly overlap with the network mediating the social cognitive and affective effects of intranasal OT ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Regions-of-interest (ROIs) were anatomically defined using the Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas ( ). Within the unilateral a priori ROIs, a threshold of   P  <.05 family-wise error (FWE) peak-level correction was set for multiple comparisons using small volume correction (SVC). Parameter estimates used for plotting and brain behavior associations analysis were extracted for each subject from a 6-mm sphere centered on the peak voxel within corresponding ROIs. For additional exploratory whole-brain analyses, a threshold of   P  <.05 corrected at peak level was used and only clusters >10 voxels are reported. 



## Results 
  
### Questionnaires 
  
Two-sample   t   tests on questionnaires measuring mood, autistic traits, empathy, and personality traits revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups (Ps>.136;  ). 


### Behavioral Results 
  
For response times, a repeated-measures ANOVA was performed with social context (social vs nonsocial) and response type (approach vs avoidance) as within-subject factors and treatment (OT vs PLC) as between-subject factor. This revealed a significant main effect of response type (F(1, 74)=250.46,   P  <.001), with subjects being significantly faster to approach positive than to avoid negative stimuli (1617.33±176.84 vs 1776.95±184.28). The interaction between social context and response was also significant (F(1, 74)=19.04,   P  <.001), with posthoc tests reavealing that subjects were faster to approach social compared with nonsocial positive stimuli (1600.86±172.73 vs 1633.79±180.49) but slower to avoid social than nonsocial negative stimuli (1784.72±181.76 vs 1769.18±187.65). There were no other significant effects (  P  >.106). 

In terms of response accuracy (RA), there was a significant main effect of social context (F(1, 74)=15.75,   P  <.001), with a higher accuracy for social compared with nonsocial stimuli (95.4%±5.7% vs 93.7%±5.4%). The main effect of response type was also significant (F(1, 74)=109.59,   P  <.001), with a higher accuracy for approaching positive than avoiding negative stimuli (97.5%±3.4% vs 91.7%±5.8%). While the interaction between social context, response type, and treatment was not significant (F(1, 74)=0.76,   P  =.385), an exploratory pairwise comparison revealed a significantly higher RA only for social (  P  =.031) but not nonsocial positive stimuli (  P  =.568) in the OT relative to the PLC group ( ). The interaction between social context and response type was marginally significant (F(1, 74)=3.18,   P  =.079), suggesting a trend of higher accuracy to social vs nonsocial stimuli for positive (  P  <.001; 98.8%±2.1% vs 96.2%±4.0%) but not negative stimuli (  P  =.280; 92.1%±6.1% vs 91.3%±5.6%). There were no other significant effects (  P  >.361). Given the slightly higher valence scores for social compared with nonsocial positive stimuli, to clarify whether the valence difference would confound the significant OT’s effects, we further conducted a correlation analysis between valence scores for individual pictures by independent raters and RA for social and nonsocial positive stimuli in the experimental subjects and found no significant associations either for social (Pearson r=0.061, df=28,   P  =.759) or nonsocial positive stimuli (Pearson r=- 0.044, df=28,   P  =.823). Thus, the magnitude of the positive valence score for the individual pictures did not influence response accuracy.

### fMRI Results 
  
We first examined unspecific effects of treatment (OT vs PLC) independent of response type and social context using a 2-sample   t   test. This revealed decreased right striatum activity (MNI=22, 2, 8, t=4.05,   P  =.025 SVC, voxels=48;  ) in the OT compared with the PLC group (OT  <PLC  ). 
  
(A) Decreased right striatum activity in the oxytocin (OT) compared with the placebo (PLC) group. (B) Decreased activity in the right striatum and the left dorsal anterior insula (AI) in the OT compared with the PLC group during appetitive approach. (C) Decreased activity in the right striatum and the right amygdala in the OT compared with the PLC group during aversive avoidance. Statistic maps were displayed with a   P  <.005 uncorrected threshold. Error bars show standard errors. 
  
Next, we examined treatment effects and interactions between treatment and social context on appetitive approach and aversive avoidance separately. For appetitive approach, decreased activity in the right striatum (MNI=20, 2, 6, t=3.96,   P  =.031 SVC, voxels=29) and the left dorsal AI (MNI=-38, 12, 6, t=3.52,   P  =.040 SVC, voxels=11;  ) was found in the OT compared with the PLC group (OT  <PLC  ). Examining the interaction between treatment and social context (OT  <PLC  ) during approach behavior revealed significant interaction effects in the left ventral AI (MNI=-42, 6, -6, t=3.57,   P  =.022 SVC, voxels=14;  ) and the right dorsal AI (MNI=48, 12, 2, t=3.40,   P  =.036 SVC, voxels=7;  ), suggesting that OT decreased activity in these regions during approach of social relative to nonsocial positive stimuli. 
  
Oxytocin (OT) decreased the left ventral anterior insula (AI) (A) and the right dorsal AI (B) activity in response to social relative to nonsocial positive stimuli (OT  <placebo [PLC]  ). Statistic maps were displayed with a   P  <.005 uncorrected threshold. Error bars show standard errors. 
  
With respect to aversive avoidance, OT decreased activity in the right striatum (MNI=24, 2, 10, t=4.31,   P  =.011 SVC, voxels=58) and the right amygdala (MNI=28, -4, -18, t=3.34,   P  =.025 SVC, voxels=2;  ) irrespective of social context (OT  <PLC  ). Examination of interaction effects between treatment and social context during avoidance behavior (OT  <PLC  ) revealed no significant effects (  P  <.05 SVC). There were also no other significant effects in the a priori ROIs (  P  <.05 SVC). For completeness, additional effects beyond the a priori ROIs on the whole-brain level are reported in   (  P  <.05). 


### Brain Behavior Associations 
  
Correlation analyses between extracted parameter estimates from the left ventral and the right dorsal AI (social positive>nonsocial positive) and RA difference scores (social positive − nonsocial positive) were conducted separately to explore associations between OT-induced modulation on neural responses and corresponding behavioral indices. Results showed a significant negative correlation between activity in the left ventral AI (MNI=-42, 6, -6) and RA difference scores in the OT (Pearson r=- 0.346, df=39,   P  =.031;  ) but not in the PLC group (Pearson r=0.039, df=37;   P  =.818). The correlation difference between groups was tested using the Fisher z-transformation test and revealed a marginally significant difference between the OT and PLC groups (Fishers z-score=-1.672,   P  =.094). 



## Discussion 
  
The present study investigated OT’s effects on AA behavior and corresponding neural mechanisms using emotional scenes and specifically examined whether the effects generalize across social and nonsocial contexts. On the neural level, a significant main effect of treatment was observed in the right striatum, with OT generally decreasing activity in this region irrespective of response type and social context. Furthermore, separate examination of appetitive approach and aversive avoidance revealed that while OT specifically decreased the left dorsal AI activity during approaching positive stimuli, it decreased right amygdala activity during avoidance of negative stimuli. Additionally, exploring the role of social context revealed evidence for a selective enhancement effect of OT on RA when approaching social relative to nonsocial positive stimuli. This behavioral effect was accompanied by decreased left ventral and right dorsal AI activity in response to social vs nonsocial positive stimuli in the OT compared with the PLC group, with the relative difference in left ventral AI activity and RA for social vs nonsocial positive stimuli exhibiting a negative association following OT. By contrast, during aversive avoidance, no evidence for the social specificity of OT was observed. These findings provide support for the GAAO by showing that OT modulates activation of motivational and emotional salience core regions during both approach to positive and avoidance to negative stimuli across social and nonsocial contexts and that OT specifically facilitates approach behavior to more personally relevant and emotionally evocative stimuli, namely positive social stimuli, via inhibiting AI activity. 

Examination of unspecific OT effects on AA behavior revealed significantly decreased activity in the right striatum following OT across both response type and social contexts. The striatum has been strongly involved in both approach (social/nonsocial reward) and avoidance (punishment/threat)-motivated behavior ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). Thus, OT may inhibit motivational representation both during appetitive approach and aversive avoidance. Furthermore, OT additionally decreased left dorsal AI activity during approach to positive stimuli across social and nonsocial contexts. As a core hub of the salience network ( ;  ), the reduced dorsal AI activity may thus reflect an OT-evoked decrease in the salience of positive stimuli when subjects approached them. 

The observed inhibitory effects of OT on striatum and AI activity seem to conflict with both the proposal that it enhances the salience of social cues ( ) and some previous findings that OT-induced alterations on human social behavior are associated with increased activity in the striatum and AI ( ;  ;  ;  ). Given that OT effects on social behavior are often highly context and person dependent ( ), this inconsistency could be due to different paradigms and contexts used in these previous studies. In previous studies, subjects were asked to passively process certain stimuli, whereas the present study using an AA task required subjects to actively approach or avoid them. 

It is notable that OT also decreased activation of the left ventral and right dorsal AI during approaching social relative to nonsocial positive stimuli. Given the role of the ventral AI in emotional processing ( ;  ;  ) and the dorsal AI in salience processing ( ;  ), these attenuated AI activities may indicate a more robust inhibitory effect of OT on decreasing both the emotional and salience processing of social positive stimuli that are more personally relevant and emotionally evocative ( ). Consistent with previous observations that OT can enhance processing of positive facial emotion ( ;  ;  ;  ), the present study found evidence that OT may specifically facilitate RA during approaching social but not nonsocial positive stimuli. Thus, the oxytocinergic downregulation of AI activation may act to attenuate interference caused by hyperactivation of the AI when subjects approach external social positive stimuli, resulting in enhanced accuracy of social information processing and facilitation of social interaction. This assumption is further supported by the presence of a significant negative correlation between the left ventral AI activity and the RA difference between social and nonsocial positive stimuli following OT but not PLC administration. However, it should be noted that the difference in brain-behavior correlation between groups was only marginally significant, and thus inferences regarding this effect of OT need to be drawn with caution. 

Additionally, OT was found to decrease amygdala activity during avoidance responses to negative stimuli independent of social context. This finding is in line with the anxiolytic action of OT via inhibiting amygdala responses to threatening stimuli ( ;  ). Based on the GAAO ( ), the absence of a social-specific effect of OT on avoiding negative stimuli suggests that threatening social and nonsocial stimuli may be comparable in terms of personal relevance and emotional evocation, perhaps due to the high survival relevance of threating events during evolution ( ). 

Given that we found no significant personality and mood difference between OT and PLC groups, this argues against confounding effects of pretreatment between-group differences on the observed effects of OT. However, individual differences in personality traits have been shown to mediate approach and avoidance behavior, as proposed by the (revised) Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory ( ;  ). More specifically, previous studies have demonstrated associations between the functional organization of the salience network, particularly the AI, and its interactions with anxiety-related traits such as harm avoidance ( ;  ,  ). Thus, future studies should consider examining the role of individual differences in personality traits on AA behavior and their potential modulatory effects on the effects of OT in this domain. Moreover, within this context, the present findings may lend support for potential therapeutic benefits of OT for psychiatric disorders such as social anxiety and autism exhibiting altered approach/avoidance towards social stimuli ( ;  ;  ;  ). 

There are several limitations in the present study. Firstly, considering that organisms have primarily evolved mechanisms to approach stimuli associated with positive outcomes and to avoid those associated with aversive ones, we only asked subjects to approach positive and avoid negative stimuli. Effects of OT on approaching negative and avoiding positive stimuli thus remain to be determined. Secondly, we used only male subjects to avoid possible confounding effects from menstrual cycle; thus, the present conclusions are limited to males and sex differences remain to be explored. Thirdly, another potential limitation is that we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a complex interaction involving differences in social and nonsocial stimuli valence and OT effects on response accuracy during approach behavior. However, for positive valence stimuli, we found no association between individual picture valence and response accuracy for either social or nonsocial stimuli, suggesting that valence differences are unlikely to have had a major impact on our results. Finally, we do not know if the effects we observed with a 40-IU dose of OT may also be observed with lower doses. A previous study has revealed a dose-dependent effect of OT (12, 24, and 48 IU), with the 24-IU dose being most effective in inhibiting amygdala activity during negative emotional processing ( ). However, in 2 previous studies from our group, we reported evidence for comparable effects of 24- and 40-IU doses on both behavioral and neural changes in the context of empathy and self-processing in humans ( ;  ). 

In conclusion, the present study provides first evidence for the GAAO by demonstrating that while OT inhibits motivational representations both during appetitive approach and aversive avoidance, it facilitates human approach behavior to more general positive social stimuli via inhibiting AI activity. This inhibitory effect of OT may reduce interference from emotion-facilitated hyperactivation of core regions of the emotional and salience networks when approaching external social salient positive stimuli and consequently be of benefit in promoting social interaction.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
In an everyday social interaction we automatically integrate another’s facial movements and vocalizations, be they linguistic or otherwise. This requires audiovisual integration of a continual barrage of sensory input—a phenomenon previously well-studied with human audiovisual speech, but not with non-verbal vocalizations. Using both fMRI and ERPs, we assessed neural activity to viewing and listening to an animated female face producing non-verbal, human vocalizations (i.e. coughing, sneezing) under audio-only (AUD), visual-only (VIS) and audiovisual (AV) stimulus conditions, alternating with Rest (R). Underadditive effects occurred in regions dominant for sensory processing, which showed AV activation greater than the dominant modality alone. Right posterior temporal and parietal regions showed an AV maximum in which AV activation was greater than either modality alone, but not greater than the sum of the unisensory conditions. Other frontal and parietal regions showed Common-activation in which AV activation was the same as one or both unisensory conditions. ERP data showed an early superadditive effect (AV > AUD + VIS, no rest), mid-range underadditive effects for auditory N140 and face-sensitive N170, and late AV maximum and common-activation effects. Based on convergence between fMRI and ERP data, we propose a mechanism where a multisensory stimulus may be signaled or facilitated as early as 60 ms and facilitated in sensory-specific regions by increasing processing speed (at N170) and efficiency (decreasing amplitude in auditory and face-sensitive cortical activation and ERPs). Finally, higher-order processes are also altered, but in a more complex fashion.

## Introduction 
  
Everyday social interactions involve the integration of auditory and visual information from speech and non-verbal social cues. These latter cues are often underemphasized in humans, as most attention tends to focus on the spoken word (Campbell et al.  ; Capek et al.  ; Frith and Frith  ; Kawashima et al.  ; Macaluso et al.  ; MacSweeney et al.  ). Humans generate many non-verbal vocalizations that are accompanied by readily identifiable stereotypical facial gestures (Howell  ). Non-verbal vocalizations likely engage higher-order processing, and can be overlooked, misused, or misinterpreted by those with social cognition disorders (Golarai et al.  ; Luyster et al.  ; Sarfati et al.  ; Troisi et al.  ). Non-verbal vocalizations can be communicative as one may purposely vocalize or exaggerate non-verbal cues to send a message, such as burp to signal the deliciousness of a meal, or one may purposely suppress a sign or yawn to conceal dissatisfaction or boredom. Social and other advantages may thus come from the ability to interpret information about the mental, emotional, or homeostatic state of individuals as conveyed through multisensory non-verbal cues. This is supported by studies that show greater activation to human non-verbal stimuli versus other non-human categories in multiple regions including STS, frontal parietal regions, and insula (Fecteau et al.  ; Lewis et al.  ). 

In a normal context, the accurate interpretation of socially related non-verbal information requires appropriate integration of multisensory input, usually visual and auditory information, which can change based on incoming information quality. In a noisy situation like a crowded bar, one observes lip and face movements more than in a quiet setting, as the visual information can effectively amplify the audio by up to 11 dB (MacLeod and Summerfield  ). Behavioral studies of both speech and non-speech stimuli indicate that multiple (congruent) stimulus modalities lead to improved processing, with both shorter reaction times and increased accuracy compared to either modality alone (Grant and Walden  ; Miller  ; Sumby and Pollack  ). 

These behavioral advantages for multisensory stimuli manifest as differences in timing, amount and type of brain activity compared to unisensory stimuli. However, studies have revealed conflicting results including both facilitation, in the form of faster and   decreased   brain responses (for fMRI Martuzzi et al.  ; Wright et al.  ; for ERPs Besle et al.  ; van Wassenhove et al.  ), and enhancement, or   increased   activation, for multisensory versus unisensory stimuli (Hubbard et al.  ; Kayser et al.  ). The reasons for these differences in multisensory effects are not understood, although some studies suggest that they may be related to factors such as congruency (Puce et al.  ; Saint-Amour et al.  ), whether one modality predicts the other (Ghazanfar et al.  ; Stekelenburg and Vroomen  ), or neuronal population properties (Laurienti et al.  ; Stevenson et al.  ). Even more complex results have been seen for higher-order regions, with effects (in speech-related studies) seen in posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and inferior frontal cortex (IFC) (Calvert et al.  ; Kawashima et al.  ). In the current study we were particularly interested in multisensory effects in pSTS due to its postulated role in social related processes (Redcay  ), and links to different visual, auditory, and motor processes (Beauchamp et al.  ). 

To investigate multisensory effects related to human non-verbal vocalizations and accompanying facial movements, we studied neural responses elicited to an animated synthetic female face producing various non-verbal vocalizations (i.e. coughing, yawning), using both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs). We presented stimuli under three conditions. In the audiovisual (AV) condition participants saw the animated face and heard congruent human vocalizations. In the visual (VIS) condition, only the animated face was seen, whereas in the auditory (AUD) condition only the vocalizations were heard. Randomized blocked presentations of AV, VIS and AUD conditions were alternated with rest (R). Two participant groups (  n   = 10 for fMRI,   n   = 13 for ERPs) responded to infrequent unisensory targets (animated face blinking, or uttering “mmm” without a visual change to the face). Our hypothesis predicted that sensory-specific regions specialized for a given unisensory condition, would show facilitated processing (faster times to peak and reduced amplitudes) in the presence of a multisensory stimulus. Specifically, for the fMRI experiment, we predicted a reduced BOLD signal for the AV versus either unimodal condition in sensory regions. For the ERP experiment, we predicted reduced amplitudes and faster latencies for early ERP components. In addition, we predicted that higher-order regions, especially right pSTS, would show greater AV activation (versus unisensory conditions) due to specialization in multisensory and/or social processes. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
For the fMRI study 10 right-handed healthy males participated (ages: 24–37 years, mean 28 years). For the ERP study, there were 13 right-handed participants (18 originally collected, 5 excluded, for the 13 included participants: 7 males, ages: 19–43 years, mean 29 years). All participants had either normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave informed consent in a study approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Participants at West Virginia University. 


### Stimuli and Task 
  
Participants viewed 4 × 4 degree videos of a synthetic female face producing facial movements and vocalizations. Stimuli were seven non-speech vocalizations with accompanying face movements consisting of a cough, sneeze, burp, yawn, laugh, sigh and whistle. Two infrequently presented unisensory target stimuli, a blink (visual) and an uttered ‘mmm’ (auditory), made participants focus on visual and auditory sensory input equally. In the Audiovisual condition, there was a 33 ms (or 1 video frame) delay between the peak movement (i.e. fully opened mouth) and sound. Animations were based on filmed real life movements associated with the seven non-verbal vocalizations of three different actors. 

Stimulus type was pseudorandomly ordered within 20 s stimulus blocks consisting of 10 trials each of combined Audiovisual stimulation (AV), Auditory stimulation only (AUD), and Visual stimulation only (VIS) (Fig.  ). In the AV participants saw the face making the facial movements and heard the associated non-speech vocalizations. In VIS, participants observed the face making movements without hearing the vocalizations. In AUD, participants viewed a neutral colored plain background (RGB = 140, 132, 127) and heard the vocalizations. The absence of the face for the AUD condition prevented an ‘incongruent’ stimulus (face still but vocalization present), but made an event-related design difficult due to onset effects. Visual motion duration and sound duration was 600 and 567 ms respectively, for all non-target stimulus types. Participants maintained their gaze on an ever-present green fixation cross and pressed a single response button when either of one of the two specified unisensory targets were seen or heard. Behavioral responses were monitored to ensure attentional alertness. Minor variations in timing occurred for the fMRI versus ERP paradigms.   
Example of a stimulus still frame depicted at the middle of an animation.   a   In the AV condition, the face is present and the non-verbal vocalization accompanies the visual stimulus. Here a yawn is depicted and the open mouth and narrowing eyes can be clearly seen.   b   In the VIS condition only the moving face is present.   c   In the AUD condition only the vocalizations are heard. For all conditions a green fixation cross was located in same position on the screen throughout scans (between the eyes when the face present in the AV and VIS conditions) 
  


### Data Acquisition 
  
#### Functional MRI Study 
  
Data were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE Horizon LX MRI scanner and quadrature birdcage headcoil. We used a 14 slice split-sagittal acquisition (Puce et al.  ), where 7 sagittal slices (3 mm thickness + 1 mm gap) were taken in each hemisphere to maximally visualize the cortex of the STS and STG (see Supplementary Fig.  ). A series of 125 gradient echo echoplanar volumes were acquired over each of the three, 4 min 10 s stimulation periods (after before and after rest period removal, total = 375 volumes) using the following parameters: TE = 35, TR = 2000, α = 70°, NEX = 1, BW = 125, FOV = 24 mm, matrix = 128 × 128 (in-plane resolution of 1.875 mm), slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm. In the Talaraich   x   plane, sagittal slice coverage was from   x   = −34 to −67, and   x   = 34 to 67. 

A T1-weighted whole brain volume which was acquired as a high-resolution spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state (SPGR) (voxel size = 1.2 × 0.9375 × 0.9375 mm; FOV = 240; matrix = 256 × 256; 124 slices). 


#### EEG/ERP Study 
  
Participants were seated comfortably in an armchair in a dimly lit room with a white noise generator. A continuous 128-channel recording of 124 channels of scalp EEG (QuikCap, Compumedics Neuroscan, El Paso, TX, USA) and 4 channels of horizontal and vertical electrooculograph (EOG) was taken using Neuroscan 4.3 software (Compumedics, Neuroscan, El Paso, TX, USA). Data were sampled at 250 Hz/channel and bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 100 Hz and amplified with a gain of 5,000. A reference consisted of two electrodes placed either side of the nose or on the cheek close to the nose. The midline frontal ground electrode was sited on the electrode cap itself. Electrode impedances were kept below 10 kΩ. 



### Data Analysis 
  
#### Functional MRI 
  
Data reconstruction was implemented via Analysis of Functional Neural Images (AFNI), version 2.31 software (Cox  ). Data processing steps included offline image reconstruction in conjunction with smoothing in Fourier space via a Fermi window (full width at half maximum = 1 voxel), correction for differences in slice-timing, and 6-parameter rigid-body motion correction. The motion estimates over the course of the scan for translation (inferior–superior, right–left, and anterior–posterior) and rotation (yaw, pitch, roll) parameter estimates were used as covariates in further analyses. 

Each image time series was spatially registered to the volume closest in time to the high-resolution structural scan both within-plane and then in all three planes using an iterative linear least squares method, to reduce the effects of head motion. AUD, VIS, and AV blocks were analyzed with a least-squares general linear model (GLM) fit that modeled each activation block and head motion parameters. Each regressor consisted of an ideal hemodynamic response function for the specified block type, obtained by convolving the event time file (across 3 concatenated imaging runs) with a γ-variate function. The beta-weights resulting from the GLM analysis were converted to percent signal change using the mean overall baseline and spatially smoothed using a 4 mm Gaussian filter. These percentage signal change maps were transformed into standardized Talaraich space. 

A voxel-by-voxel parametric two-tailed   t   test was used on the percent signal change maps for a group comparison of each condition (versus rest) separately, plus AV versus AUD + VIS.   P  -value correction for multiple comparisons was based on a combination of threshold cutoff and cluster extent using 3dmerge (AFNI). Minimal cluster size was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation program AlphaSim (AFNI). For a masked AFNI image, AlphaSim ran 1,000 iterations, with a radius connectivity of 4.1 (since slice thickness + gap was 4 mm) and image defined Gaussian filters with FWHM determined with 3dFWHM. The minimal cluster size to avoid false cluster detection was 57 voxels for   P   < 0.05, 16 voxels for   P   < 0.01, 11 voxels for   P   < 0.005, 6 voxels for   P   < 0.001. Alpha maps were overlaid on inflated PALS atlas cortical model brains (Van Essen  ; Van Essen et al.  ). 

Regions of interest (ROIs) were based on significant activation from the analyses above. The average time course of the MR BOLD response in select ROIs was generated using the AFNI 3dDeconvolve program with the iresp option. The average time courses for each condition (AUD, VIS, AV, ApV) were averaged within each ROI and normalized across datasets. For a given hemisphere, we took voxels showing significant activation from that hemisphere plus its mirror opposite correlate (using 3dLRflip in AFNI), such that each ROI had equivalent right and left hemisphere volumes. 


#### Event-Related Potentials 
  
ERP analysis was performed using Neuroscan 4.3 Software (Neurosoft, Inc., Sterling, VA, USA). EEG data were first segmented into 1500 ms epochs with 100 ms pre-stimulus baseline based on the event markers which identified each trial type. The EEG data of the target trials were not included in subsequent analyses (similar to the fMRI study). Epochs containing artifact registering greater than ±100 μV, due primarily to eye blinks, or electromyographic activity due to face or head motion, were excluded from subsequent analyses. We excluded data from five of the eighteen participants (three participants had technically suboptimal studies due to excessive eye blinks/muscle activity in their EEG data, and two participants were deemed to be overly familiar with the stimuli and showed low alertness levels during the study), leaving thirteen participants in the final ERP analyses. 

The zero time point was the start of the audio, visual or simultaneous audiovisual stimulus. Individual epochs were normalized relative to a 100 ms prestimulus baseline, and linear trend was calculated and removed across the entire epoch, based on the prestimulus baseline. Stimulus types for each condition (AUD, VIS, AV) were averaged across all 6 runs. Each participant’s averaged ERP data were then digitally smoothed with a zero phase-shift low pass filter (cut-off 30 Hz, 6 dB/octave). 

Group averages were constructed and the averaged ERPs were scrutinized to identify ERP peaks and troughs. P100, N170, P250, and P500 ERP components were identified in the group average waveforms. Area under the curve (AUC) ranges were also selected for certain broader peaks. Latency ranges (windows) were selected for each grand average ERP peak or trough, and an automated peak picking routine was then run on the averaged ERP data of each individual subject. Area under the curve (AUC) measures were also taken for selected ERP components. Each subject’s ERP waveforms and ERP peak amplitude and latency measures and AUCs were exported as sets of ASCII files. 

Topographic voltage maps were created from the grand average ERP data at peak and trough timepoints to examine the regional distribution of ERP activity. Data from multiple sensors showing similar ERP behavior were then averaged as noted in the results section, with location of sensor markers determined by averaging Polhemus digitizer locations. 

Data at eye channels were also displayed in order to determine whether ERP signals may have been influenced by systematic, but subtle, eye movements. The signal excursion for the artifact free data in the eye channels was small (on the order of μV) and therefore did not appear to be due to actual eye movements which typically generate signals on the order of mV. In addition, the lower horizontal EOG channels did not show an equal and opposite negativity, suggesting that the positivity in the upper vertical EOG channel, located on the forehead, was likely due to frontal brain activity and not to eye related activity per se. 


#### Statistical Analysis of ERP Data 
  
Student’s   t   tests, one-way (Condition) and two-way (Condition by Hemisphere) ANOVAs of peak amplitudes, latencies, and AUC for particular ERP components were analyzed using SPSS V15. In order to objectively determine the timepoints for AUC measures, we calculated timepoint by timepoint values for the   t   test difference for AV versus AUD plus VIS. Thus, we set as time regions for AUC, periods of sustained (20 ms, 5 timepoints) significant differences (  t   > 1.67 for   n   = 60 epochs) between the multisensory and sum of the unisensory conditions. We used similar calculations to measure the time elapsed, after which no significant peaks occurred, an effective Return to Baseline (RTB). To determine the RTB we first calculated the   t   value versus zero for each point on the waveform. The RTB was defined as the end of the last significant peak of sustained (20 ms, 5 timepoints) significance. 




## Results 
  
### fMRI Data 
  
Ten participants completed the non-verbal unisensory target detection task in a 3T MRI scanner. A split sagittal slice acquisition optimized sampling of temporal cortex, but excluded medial regions as well as more medial aspects of frontal parietal cortex, fusiform and early visual cortex. 

All three conditions produced robust activation in sensory and higher-order cognitive regions. AUD and AV conditions produced additional and extensive activation of mid- to anterior STS and mid-insula (Fig.  a, c), whereas VIS and AV conditions produced activation of lateral occipital and posterior middle temporal gyrus (LO/pMTG) and lateral fusiform gyrus (Fig.  b, c). Brain regions showed multisensory relationships that fell into four main categories (Fig.  ):

Warm colors   represent net positive BOLD signal,   cool colors   represent net negative BOLD signal.   d   Difference maps for VIS versus AUD. Regions more active in the VIS condition are represented by   warm colors   (  P   < 0.01 corrected).   e   Common activation maps (  black  ) for AV, VIS and AUD (  P   < 0.001 corrected).

Histograms depict relative fMRI percent signal change for all three conditions in   underadditive   ROIs (  a  –  c  )   AV maximum   (  d  –  e  ) and   common-activation   ROIs (  f  ).   Asterisks   indicate pairwise   t   test significance: *   P   < 0.05, **   P   < 0.01, ***   P   < 0.001 
    
 superadditive  , defined as audiovisual greater than the sum of auditory alone and visual alone i.e. AV > ApV; 
  
 underadditive  , defined as audiovisual less than the sum of auditory and visual alone, and audiovisual less than the dominant sensory modality e.g. AV < ApV and AV < AUD or VIS; 
  
 AV maximum  , defined as audiovisual greater than either unisensory condition along (AV > VIS and AV > AUD, and VIS > 0, AUD > 0). 
  
 Common activation  , defined as AV activation equal to one or both conditions (AV = AUD and/or VIS. Note that for both AV maximum and Common activation, audiovisual would be less than the sum of the unisensory conditions (AV < ApV). 
  

Two regions showed mathematical   superadditivity,   the right insula/frontal operculum and left angular gyrus. However, this resulted from negative activation versus baseline in one or in all three conditions, and neither region showed significant positive activation for the AV condition (solid white outlines, Fig.  d). 

Several regions showed significant or near-significant   underadditive   effects including MTG, LO/pMTG, and lateral fusiform gyri, with the AV condition showing decreased activation compared with either unisensory condition or the sum of the unisensory conditions, ApV (Table  A). The AUD-preferred region, left mid-MTG, showed a trend (  P   < 0.1) of AV < AUD. Similarly, for the VIS-preferred regions, LO and fusiform gyrus, there was a significant difference and trend, respectively, of AV < VIS. LO and fusiform also showed a right-hemisphere bias (Table  A).   
Summary of significant and trend effects resulting from 2-way ANOVA comparisons for (A) fMRI and (B) ERPs 
  
The middle columns show the results of AV versus ApV, while the right columns show the effects for AV versus VIS and AV versus AUD. B has an additional set of columns for ERP latency effects.   Asterisks   indicate   P  -value of   F   statistic: *   P   < 0.05, **   P   < 0.01, ***   P   < 0.001, ****   P   < 0.00001. All effects were tested, but non-significant interactions are listed as n.s. or are omitted. In several cases, noteworthy   t   tests are listed 
  

 AV maximum   and Common activation   effects were seen in frontal, parietal and temporal regions (Black overlay at   P   < 0.001, Fig.  d). The pSTS, TPJ, IFG, and DLPFC all showed strong condition effects for AV < ApV (Table  B). Portions of these regions were also revealed in a voxelwise   t   test of AV versus ApV (dashed white lines in Fig.  d). The pSTS showed a significant hemisphere effect (right > left), with the VIS condition showing the strongest lateralization (  t   = 4.98,   P   < 0.005).   AV maximum   activation was seen in several of these regions, including right posterior pSTG (  P   < 0.01 versus VIS,   P   < 0.001 versus AUD), and TPJ (  P   < 0.01, versus VIS,   P   < 0.05 versus AUD). IFG and DLPFC showed   common activation,   with the AUD condition showing the least activation in DLPFC. 

The STS and IFG regions, in addition to showing at least a trend towards hemisphere effects for amplitude of activation (Table  A), also showed a greater number of active voxels in the right versus left hemisphere (Right STS: 134 versus Left STS: 0; Right IFG: 1871 mm  versus Left IFG: 157 mm ), thus showing right hemisphere dominance in both magnitude and extent of activation. 

A separate group of 13 participants participated in the ERP version of the experiment. Since the neutral, eyes forward face was present as a baseline for the duration of VIS and AV blocks (except during movements), the zero time point for ERP measurements is at the onset of the facial movement and/or simultaneous vocalization (for AUD, onset of vocalization). In general, ERP waveforms revealed modality-specific early components with characteristic topographies and morphologies, in addition to a late positivity (Fig.  ). Stimuli containing auditory stimulation (AUD and AV conditions) showed the typical auditory N140 with an amplitude maximum at midline central electrodes. Stimuli containing visual stimulation (VIS and AV conditions) showed the typical face-specific N170 at bilateral temporo-occipital electrodes, showing delayed latencies typical of dynamic visual stimuli. In addition to showing both typical auditory and face-related components, the AV condition also elicited a unique early positivity in left parieto-occipital electrodes. All three conditions showed a diffuse late positivity which lasted up to 1500 ms, and varied in amplitude between conditions. A   t   test of AV versus ApV was used to search for regions of potential multisensory effects. Again, effects were grouped into the four categories of   superadditive  ,   underadditive, AV maximum   and   common-activated  .   
Group average topographic ERP maps as a function of condition and time. Topographic maps are depicted at post-stimulus time points of 80, 140, 270 ms, and then every 100 ms for all three stimulus conditions (  top three rows  ). The   bottom row   shows difference maps for the AV condition minus the sum of the unisensory conditions (ApV).   Red-yellow   shows positive ERP activity,   blue-aqua   show negative ERP activity. Topographic maps showing timepoints analyzed in subsequent figures are labeled 
  

#### Superadditivity at 60–148 ms 
  
At this relatively early post-stimulus time range, the AV condition elicited an early positivity in bilateral temporo-occipital electrodes that was not seen in either unisensory condition (Figs.  ,  a). We performed a timepoint-by-timepoint   t   test analysis to determine the time range showing significant differences between AV and AUD plus VIS (i.e. AV versus ApV), and performed an AUC analysis for this time range (60–148 ms). A two-way ANOVA revealed superadditivity, with main effects of Hemisphere [  F  (2,24) = 16.67,   P   < 0.01].

Topographic map shows 12 sampled electrodes (  white dots  ). Waveform for 6 averaged right temporal occipital electrodes shows unique peak for AV (  black circle  ).   Asterisks   indicate pairwise   t   test significance 
  


#### Trend Towards Underadditivity for N140 
  
AUD and AV, but not VIS, conditions elicited a central negativity at 144.7 ms, typical for auditory stimuli (Fig.  a). Peak amplitude analysis revealed a trend for AUD > AV (Table  B), but found no significant super- or underadditivity.

Averaged ERP waveforms for sampled electrode sites (  white dots   on topographic maps), appear at the right of the histograms.   Asterisks   indicate pairwise   t   test significance.   P  -values listed for non-significant trends 
  


#### Underadditivity for N170 
  
All three conditions produced a negativity at an average 276.7 ms, with preference for conditions including visual stimuli (Fig.  b). The waveform was characteristic of the N170 which is elicited by dynamic faces, peaking at temporo-occipital electrodes, with a right hemisphere bias (Fig.  c, white dots). As the stimulus was dynamic, the N170 was considerably delayed relative to the 170 ms typical for the presentation of static face stimuli (see Puce et al.  ). Face movement began at 0 ms and was generally identifiable as a particular “vocalization” by 33 ms. Although the AV and VIS N170 s were larger, the AUD condition also elicited a negativity that had a similar timecourse at these electrodes (274.8 ms). The N170 was underadditive, such that AV < ApV, and showed condition and hemisphere main effects (Table  B). Peak analysis revealed reduced amplitude and decreased latency for the AV versus VIS condition, as well as a right hemisphere bias for amplitude (Table  B). 


#### AV Maximum and Common Activation for Late Positivities 
  
All three conditions elicited widely distributed late positivities (Fig.  ). A strict AV versus ApV   t   test revealed an underadditivity at bilateral temporo-parietal electrodes at 230–304 ms (timepoint-by-timepoint   t   test, Fig.  a). Even though the peaks were broad, we used a semi-automated peak analysis with verification of peaks in individual subjects data. We wanted to examine the data for latency differences, and more strictly apply multisensory criteria (at the time of the AV and AUD peaks, the VIS peak has yet to appear). The temporo-parietal peak occurred at 240 and 244 ms respectively for the AUD and AV conditions, but was delayed at 328 ms for the VIS condition. This peak was considered a   common activation,   as analysis, using the homologous peaks for all three conditions, did not show any significant amplitude differences between conditions (Table  B).

Rightmost panel in each row shows ERP waveforms for each condition along with AV-ApV topographic maps (sampled electrodes are   white dots  ).   Asterisks   indicate pairwise   t   test significance. Very late timeranges show common activation in occipital and frontal electrode sites (  c  –  e  ) 
  

An underadditivity was seen at right fronto-temporal electrodes at 460–616 ms (timepoint-by-timepoint   t   test, Fig.  b). Latency of this broad peak was also greatest for the VIS condition (492 ms) and was similar across the AUD and AV conditions (384 and 400 ms, respectively). Analysis of homologous peaks revealed a Condition effect, with the AUD condition showing the smallest amplitude (Table  B). This peak was considered an   AV maximum  , as the AV condition was significantly greater than either unisensory condition in the right hemiscalp, and a similar trend was seen in the mirror opposite electrodes (Fig.  b). 

 Common activation   was seen at several other electrode sites, include occipital and frontal electrodes. Occipital electrodes showed equivalent sustained activation for all three conditions in the 700–800 ms range (Fig.  c). In contrast, for frontal electrodes, F5 and FPZ, late sustained activation was only seen for AV and VIS conditions and not the AUD condition (rectangles, Fig.  d, e). Note at F5 the   AV maximum   peaks at the 250 ms and 450 ms ranges (circle, Fig.  d). 



### Results Summary 
  
The ERP data showed a unique early positivity for the AV condition starting at 60 ms. In sum, however, there was convergence of ERP and fMRI data. Both the N140 (generated in the superior temporal plane) (Giard et al.  ; Godey et al.  ; Ponton et al.  ), and the auditory STS showed non-significant trends towards underadditivity. For VIS related processing, AV activation was significantly reduced (smaller amplitude ERPs and BOLD responses) compared to the preferred unisensory stimuli (VIS). Finally, multiple “higher-order” cortical regions, as well as late time ranges typically associated with more higher-order processes showed significant or near significant trends of AV maximum activation (AV greater than either condition alone). Other regions/timeranges showed common activation in which AV and one or both conditions showed similar degrees of activation. Several of these regions and timeranges showed a right hemisphere bias. 



## Discussion 
  
Using an animated synthetic face and associated real human non-verbal vocalizations we elicited reliable fMRI activation to unisensory and multisensory stimulation in an imaging study designed to optimally image the STS/STG in its entirety, while still including face-sensitive and auditory regions in lateral sensory cortex. In a second group of subjects we elicited reproducible and consistent ERPs to the relatively long durations of the facial motion and associated vocalizations. Subjects were asked to detect unisensory target stimuli (a blink and an “mmm” sound) so that we could study audiovisual integration without a bias to a particular sensory modality. We discuss our results, summarized in Fig.  , in the context of other audiovisual non-biological and speech integration studies, and in more general terms of social cognition.   
Summary of main fMRI and ERP findings in terms of time of occurrence relative to stimulus onset and type of multisensory phenomenon 
  

### Multisensory Effects in Sensory-Related Processes 
  
Multisensory effects were seen in early regions (fMRI data) and ERP components which supported our hypotheses predicting facilitation effects. Interestingly, we also observed a unique early AV ERP component. This AV positivity peaking around 60–80 ms is similar to that seen in recent audiovisual integration studies (Giard and Peronnet  ; Shams et al.  ). Somewhat surprisingly, these studies, which used   non-biological   stimuli, showed early AV integration effects whose laterality was opposite to ours. Giard and Perronet ( ) proposed that their early ERP response may stem from the recruitment of specific multisensory cells in or near striate cortex, where bisensory cells have been seen observed in animals (Fishman and Michael  ; Morrell  ). Due to our slice selection in our fMRI study, we could not confirm whether multisensory effects occurred in early visual cortex, however, such early effects in humans have been seen in other studies (Martuzzi et al.  ). 

Aside from the unique AV ERP signal, AUD and VIS-related sensory-related regions and ERP signals showed multisensory effects characteristic of facilitation, as predicted by our hypothesis. Significant effects were seen in VIS-related regions (LO) and ERP components (N170), and trends in the same direction were seen in fMRI activated AUD-related regions and ERP components (mid-MTG and N140). The strongest case of fMRI and ERP convergence was at mid-level visual processes, characterized by a right hemisphere bias and decrease in both amplitude (fMRI and ERP) and speed (ERP) of AV versus VIS. 

The auditory trend towards facilitation was consistent with the role of the centrally located N140 in multisensory integration (Besle et al.  ; Puce et al.  ; van Wassenhove et al.  ). A study by Puce et al. ( ) showed the largest N140s were elicited when a dynamic human face (relative to house and primate face stimuli) was paired with incongruous sounds, suggesting that the context provided by a conspecific (human) face influences associated auditory processing. Additionally, when congruous sounds were presented, the N140 was largest to both human and primate faces when paired with species-appropriate vocalizations relative to a house stimulus whose front door opened with a creaking door sound (Puce et al.  ). However, unlike previous ERP studies using speech stimuli (Besle et al.  ; van Wassenhove et al.  ), our results here did not reach significance, perhaps due to differences in timing of facial movements relative to vocalizations. In our paradigm, face movement and audio were simultaneous, although there was a natural delay in the movement peaking for our non-verbal stimuli (e.g. fully open mouth, upturned eyes in the sigh in Fig.  ), which is opposite to speech stimuli. Ghazanfar et al. (Ghazanfar et al.  ) also have shown that timing plays a critical role in multisensory effects in an experiment in which monkeys were presented conspecific coos and grunts along with images of primate faces, however, in this experiment static faces of primates were utilized. Multisensory neurons in the auditory core and belt regions showed more enhancement when the face versus audio delay was less than 100 ms, and facilitation when the delay was greater than 200 ms. The variance of these studies based on timing underscores the importance of subtle audio versus visual onset time differences in multisensory processing. 

Reduced activation in the AV condition could be due to various causes, including less energy demands brought about by facilitated processing. Alternatively, the relative decrease in amplitude in the multisensory relative to the unisensory conditions may be due a smaller population of neurons with exclusively multisensory versus unisensory preferences (Beauchamp  ; Laurienti et al.  ). Alternatively, the distribution of resources available to process these stimuli might be limited over multiple sensory cortical regions. We favor the increased efficiency explanation in the light of the behavioral facilitation effects observed in many studies (Bolognini et al.  ; Gondan et al.  ; Grant and Walden  ; Miller  ; Sumby and Pollack  ), although all three explanations are plausible and cannot be differentiated in the current dataset. Multisensory optimization may also take the form of synchronization of the phase of oscillatory stimuli (such as gamma band activity) (Engel et al.  ; Schroeder et al.  ; Senkowski et al.  ), which can produce important behavioral sequelae (Schroeder et al.  ). Future studies quantifying ERP amplitudes and latencies, oscillatory activity and behavior in a combined manner might better clarify the underlying nature of these processes. 

#### Higher-Order Underadditive Effects 
  
We saw significant activation by all three conditions in putative higher-order cognitive processes (based on latencies (ERP data) and origins (fMRI data); Doeller et al.  ; van Herten et al.  ; Vuilleumier and Pourtois  ). Here a clear case for convergence is more difficult to make since later ERPs are typically diffusely distributed, making source localization challenging, as they can potentially come from multiple sources (Siedenberg et al.  ; Soltani and Knight  ). However in our study, later ERPs, and activation in higher-order brain regions as revealed by fMRI showed spatially distributed responses and a combination of   AV maximum   and   Common activation   responses. From the fMRI side, this network of frontal, temporal and parietal regions has been implicated in other studies as playing an important role in multisensory perception (for review see Ghazanfar and Schroeder  ), as well as for understanding speech and socially related stimuli (Calvert et al.  ; Moll and de Oliveira-Souza  ). For the ERPs, there were multiple distributed late peaks that showed an AV response with properties from both unisensory conditions (AV elicited larger amplitudes like the VIS condition and faster latencies like the AUD condition). 

It is much more difficult to attribute higher-order activation as being specifically related to multisensory processing, as these regions did not show superadditivity, perhaps due to ceiling effects from these robust stimuli (Stevenson et al.  ). In addition, higher order processes can be non-specific and can be very sensitive to other factors such as attention. The target stimuli were always unisensory, and therefore there were two possible unisensory targets in the AV blocks. It is possible that in the AV and VIS conditions responding to the corresponding unisensory target stimulus may have resulted in potentially greater stimulus-driven attentional effects. Having said that, the STS, IFG, and TPJ have shown potential multisensory behavior in other studies where the task requirements did not involve such contingencies (Calvert et al.  ; Kawashima et al.  ). Additionally, the blocked-event design in this study could conceivably have produced some refractoriness effects in the data, and in other studies (Calvert et al.  ; Kawashima et al.  ), albeit unlikely. Ideally, an event-related design would circumvent these kinds of issues. 

Notably, all three conditions in our study activated right pSTS, a region previously shown to be important in social-related multisensory processing (Redcay  ). Right pSTS along with right TPJ, were the only regions in which there was maximum activation in the AV condition. Further evidence of pSTS importance in both multisensory and social processing come from prior research on a possible pSTS homologue in monkeys, the Anterior Superior Temporal Polysensory Area (STPa), which responds to visual biological motion, faces, and head and body view and direction (Jellema et al.  ; Oram and Perrett  ), and projects to higher order cognitive and emotional processing regions such as the amygdala and prefrontal regions (Oram and Perrett  ). 

In addition, we saw right-hemisphere dominated effects in STS and frontal regions, which is typically not seen in most speech related studies (Campbell et al.  ; Capek et al.  ; Hubbard et al.  ; Kawashima et al.  ; Macaluso et al.  ; MacSweeney et al.  ; Skipper et al.  ). However, left lateralized activation has been less strongly observed in multisensory studies of simple speech, syllables, and emotional prosody (Kreifelts et al.  ; Olson et al.  ; Wright et al.  ). It is possible that higher-order regions in both hemispheres have multisensory properties and are recruited based on verbal versus non-verbal relevance. 



### Summary 
  
Both imaging modalities produced datasets that were very complex, yet there was a surprising degree of convergence between the ERP and fMRI data (Fig.  ). Underadditivity dominated the multisensory effects in earlier regions as supported by the significant (VIS areas) and trend towards (AUD) smaller and faster responses for AV versus unisensory stimuli. These data, along with previous behavioral studies, suggest that early or mid-sensory regions may be optimized to process multisensory stimuli, if information from multiple modalities is available (Foxe and Schroeder  ). Multiple “higher-order” cortical regions, as well as late ERP activity typically associated with more higher-order processes showed underadditive effects driven by common activation for all conditions of non-verbal human stimuli, with a dominance of the AV condition in temporal regions. In particular the unique right pSTS effects confirm the important role of pSTS in social cognition, and again show the tendency toward right lateralization for social-related stimuli.

Group-level, whole-brain random-effects analyses and voxelwise contrasts (dynamic > static, task > baseline) are reported with thresholding and cluster correction; coordinates and tables of results are provided. The study therefore provides univariate whole-brain task-evoked maps for healthy adults. It is not ROI-only, not connectivity-only, and not a non-empirical paper. All inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are violated.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study in healthy adults (N=25, mean age ~25) using task-based imaging of faces with manipulated facial color — a social-perception/relevant social communication construct (perception/understanding of others: emotion/health cues). The paper reports group-level, whole-brain univariate task contrasts (natural-colored faces vs. scrambled images) with voxelwise results and cluster coordinates (Table 1, group-level maps at P<1e-3 uncorrected), meeting the whole-brain evidence requirement. Results for healthy participants are reported separately and are generalizable to healthy adults. The study does not rely solely on ROI, connectivity, or resting-state analyses. Therefore it satisfies all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical fMRI study of social-related processing: subjects learned facts about people (versus buildings and hammers) and the paper explicitly tests person-selective responses. Sample: healthy adult participants (N=12; ages 20–32) within the 17–65 range. The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain voxelwise analyses (conjunction contrasts, cluster-size correction, Talairach-space maps) identifying person-selective clusters in the anterior temporal lobes and other social cognition regions; results are described as whole-brain statistical maps and ROI/cluster results. Although functional connectivity is also reported, the paper includes task-evoked whole-brain activation maps for the healthy group. No exclusion criteria are violated (not ROI-only, not resting-state-only, healthy adults reported separately). Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria.</p>

The full text describes group-level neural activity in face- and emotion-processing regions (amygdala, fusiform, insula) and discusses task-evoked whole-brain effects; these constitute univariate, voxelwise, group-level results generalizable to healthy adults. Although functional coupling analyses are also reported, the paper clearly provides whole-brain task activation findings rather than ROI-only or connectivity-only results. Participant age range and healthy-group analyses are implicit in the methods and results focusing on nonclinical adult samples. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for fMRI studies of social-related processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social processing in healthy adults (N=16, ages 18–25) using a social competitive task (matching-pennies) involving human and non-human agents. The paper reports whole-brain, group-level univariate GLM results with second-level random-effects analyses (voxelwise threshold p<.001 and cluster-level FWE correction p<.05), including tables of peak coordinates and figures. The task probes perception/understanding of others and mentalizing, fitting the review constructs. No ROI-only, connectivity-only, or resting-state-only limitations apply, and participant ages fall within 17–65. Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria and violates none of the exclusion criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical, task-based fMRI study of social communication (emotional speech prosody) in healthy adult participants (n=22, mean age 24.8, within 17–65). The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task contrasts (emotional > neutral prosody) with cluster-corrected results (PFDR < 0.05) and associated tables/figures, satisfying the whole-brain evidence requirement. Although ROI analyses are also presented, whole-brain activation maps are clearly reported for the healthy sample. No exclusion criteria are met (not an ROI-only, connectivity-only, between-group-only, or non-empirical study), and results are generalizable to healthy adults. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for the review.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This paper reports original fMRI data in healthy adult participants (three studies, combined N=59; all participants unique and within adult age range). Each study implemented social-related tasks (person knowledge, famous names, socially relevant words) and appropriate non-social controls. The authors conducted voxelwise, group-level whole-brain univariate analyses (SPM8) reporting contrasts of interest (social > non-social semantics) with cluster- and voxel-level thresholds and provide peak coordinates and whole-brain results in text/tables/figures. Analyses are clearly identified as coming from the healthy control groups. No exclusion criteria are violated (not ROI-only, not connectivity-only, includes whole-brain task activations, healthy adult sample). Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for fMRI studies of social-related processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This paper reports task-based functional MRI in healthy adult participants performing action observation and weight-discrimination tasks that target "Perception and Understanding of Others," a social-related construct. Multiple experiments include healthy control groups (total N across experiments reported; Experiment details show group-level analyses of healthy participants) and the clinical SCA6 group is analyzed separately with control results reported independently. The manuscript presents group-level, univariate whole-brain voxelwise contrasts (e.g., ActionOBS–CtrlOBS; Sleeve/NoSleeve conditions) with thresholded statistical maps, cluster-wise and peak-level results, and overlap/consistency analyses; figures and threshold information are provided. The study does not rely solely on ROI, connectivity, or resting-state analyses.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study reports an fMRI task of emotional sentence attribution (EMO) versus grammatical classification (GRAM), a social cognition task involving emotion processing and theory-of-mind/reasoning about others. The sample includes a healthy adult group (n=25, age range mean 33.1) reported separately alongside a clinical group. Whole-brain, voxelwise group-level analyses are reported with FWE correction (p<0.05) for task effects, group effects, and task×group interactions. The paper explicitly states that healthy controls significantly activated the medial prefrontal cortex during the emotion attribution task (and presents whole-brain statistical maps/peaks), satisfying the requirement for a healthy-group, whole-brain, univariate task-evoked map. The task and reported contrasts are clearly social-related and generalizable to healthy adults. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This paper reports an fMRI study using a validated social cognition task (HCP Animated Triangles social cognition paradigm) and includes a healthy adult control group (n=25) alongside first-episode schizophrenia patients. The manuscript provides group-level, voxelwise whole-brain activation results for healthy controls (e.g., V5, pSTS and other clusters) with MNI coordinates and FWE-corrected statistics, clearly described as coming from the healthy/control group. Thus it meets: (1) use of an fMRI social-related task; (2) a healthy adult sample reported separately; and (3) whole-brain univariate task-evoked maps generalizable to healthy adults. Although the paper also reports connectivity/DCM analyses and a clinical group, these do not preclude inclusion because healthy-group whole-brain results are explicitly provided. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria.</p>

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder thought to result from synaptic dysfunction that affects distributed brain connectivity, rather than any particular brain region. While symptomatology is traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms, abnormal social cognition is now recognized a key component of schizophrenia. Nonetheless, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of effective brain connectivity in schizophrenia during social cognition and how it relates to clinical symptomatology. To address this question, we used fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test for abnormal brain connectivity in twenty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) compared to twenty-five matched controls performing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) social cognition paradigm. Patients had not received regular therapeutic antipsychotics, but were not completely drug naïve. Whilst patients were less accurate than controls in judging social stimuli from non-social stimuli, our results revealed an increase in feedforward connectivity from motion-sensitive V5 to posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in patients compared to matched controls. At the same time, patients with a higher degree of positive symptoms had more disinhibition within pSTS, a region computationally involved in social cognition. We interpret these findings the framework of active inference, where increased feedforward connectivity may encode aberrant prediction errors from V5 to pSTS and local disinhibition within pSTS may reflect aberrant encoding of the precision of cortical representations about social stimuli.

## Introduction 
  
Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide ( ). The symptoms of first-episode schizophrenia manifest across an age range from adolescence to early adulthood ( ). The highest incidence of first-episode schizophrenia is around age 22 ( ;  ), whereas early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) (age 14–18) is very rare, has a more severe prognosis and many EOS patients are rediagnosed later in life ( ,  ). While symptomatology is traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms on the one hand, and cognitive deficits on the other, abnormal social cognition is recognized a key component of schizophrenia ( ). Recent research has shown that patients with high levels of both positive and negative symptoms, or negative symptoms alone, have more profound deficits in theory of mind compared to patients with only positive symptoms ( ,  ). While negative symptoms have been associated with hypo-mentalizing similar to autism ( ), positive symptoms have been associated with hyper-mentalizing, in particular delusions and paranoia ( ). Importantly, it has been suggested that patients with schizophrenia could be switching between hyper- and hypo-mentalizing, depending on social context ( ,  ). 

Theory of mind refers to the belief that other people have minds different from our own ( ). From a computational perspective, it is an agent’s ability to generate an internal model of another agent’s beliefs about the world. This internal model is necessary to explain other agents’ behavior in terms of their intentions, goals and desires ( ). Without a generative model of mental states to explain observed behavior, one wouldn’t know that a smile (behavior) is caused by happiness (mental state) or that tears can be happy or sad, depending on which theory of mind (model) we adopt. One of the most validated and widely used theory-of-mind tasks is the “Animated Triangles” task ( ,  ,  ). Brain mapping studies using fMRI have consistently associated theory of mind with increased activation of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the medial prefrontal cortex ( ,  ). This paradigm has also been used to identify abnormal BOLD activation in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls ( ,  ,  ,  ; A.  ). However, in contrast to healthy subjects with normal neurodevelopment, brain activation in patients with schizophrenia has been inconsistent. While Das   et al.   found reduced activation of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG) in male patients with established schizophrenia ( ,  ), Martin   et al.   showed increased activation of bilateral IFG, left STG and left caudate nucleus ( ) in chronic, medicated patients. In contrast, Bliksted   et al.   found that largely drug-naïve first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients hyper-mentalized during non-social stimuli, accompanied by increased activation of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex ( ). 

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder thought to emerge with synaptic dysfunction ( ,  ,  ). A variety of studies using non-invasive electrophysiology (EEG and MEG) have identified abnormal post-synaptic responses to both auditory stimuli ( ,  ,  ), visual stimuli ( ,  ,  ,  ) and tactile stimuli ( ,  ) in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. In addition to the abnormal neurophysiology that inherits from synaptic dysfunction, there is some evidence of widespread white-matter abnormalities that could impair axonal conduction between brain areas ( ,  ,  ). However, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of effective brain connectivity in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. 

To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test for abnormal brain connectivity in twenty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) compared to twenty-five matched controls during the HCP social cognition paradigm ( ). First, we use Bayesian model reduction and parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) ( ) to test for aberrant feedforward, feedback and intrinsic (inhibitory) connectivity in FES patients. Finally, we use PEB and Bayesian model comparison to test how these connectivity estimates are differentially related to positive and negative symptomatology. 


## Material and methods 
  
### Patients 
  
We initially recruited 31 patients from the OPUS Clinic, a first-episode schizophrenia clinic at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. While each patient met the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia, they had no history of neurological disorder or severe head trauma according to ICD-10, nor did they have an ICD-10 diagnosis of drug- or alcohol dependency. Patients were excluded if they had an estimated premorbid IQ < 70 based on their history or if they were not able to understand spoken Danish sufficiently well to comprehend the testing procedures. Seven patients were excluded from the fMRI experiment due to dental braces (N = 3), pregnancy (N = 1) and several no-shows (N = 3). Finally, 24 first-episode patients were included in the fMRI experiment. Given that our patients were newly diagnosed, most of them did not receive regular doses of antipsychotic medication at a therapeutic level that could be converted to standard chlorpromazine equivalents ( ). Some of the patients received their initial depot injection a few days before the MRI scan, so that a stable, therapeutic concentration was not yet expected. Other patients only agreed to take very low doses of antipsychotics used as an   ad hoc   sedative in order to fall asleep (e.g. 25 mg Quetiapine, where 750 mg is the expected clinical antipsychotic dose). See   for a summary of the patients' medication history.

### Healthy controls 
  
We initially recruited 29 healthy controls. Exclusion criteria were the same as for the patients, except that controls were excluded if they or a first-degree relative had an ICD-10 diagnosis, or if a diagnosis was confirmed during the Present State Examination (PSE) interview (ICD-10, WHO). Four controls were excluded from the fMRI experiment on the day of scanning: two had dental braces and two left the study prematurely. FES patients and healthy controls were intended matched on age, gender, educational level (last commenced education), and parental socioeconomic status (SES). However, we did not succeed completely with this strategy, so the two groups ended up being matched on a group level. Finally, 25 healthy controls were included in the fMRI study. 


### Psychopathology and social functioning 
  
First-episode schizophrenia patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist with the Present State Examination interview regarding schizophrenia and drug dependency ( ). All FES patients and healthy controls were rated with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) ( ,  ). Level of psychosocial functioning was measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F) ( ) and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) ( ). 


### Intelligence and social cognition 
  
We estimated intelligence using two subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) ( ). The two subtests were chosen based on their high correlation with the total WAIS-III IQ-score: Block Design and Vocabulary. Theory of mind ability was evaluated diagnostically using the “Animated Triangles” task ( ). In the “random” condition, the triangles move randomly about. In the “theory of mind” condition, the animated triangles move in a coordinated fashion that resembles a social interaction, a scenario that normally developing individuals consistently explain using theory of mind ( ). There are four clips of each type of animation with 38–41 s duration. After each animation, the participants were asked to describe what they thought was happening and their answers were scored regarding degree of mental state attribution (range 0–5) and appropriateness of their description (range 0–3) as outlined in Appendix 2 of ( ). Each answer was scored by two clinical psychologists (LV and VB) and the ordinal scores were summed within category for statistical analysis. Using the Mann-Whitney   U   test, we then tested for differences in the distribution of scores between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Intraclass correlation (ICC) in a two-way random-effects model showed absolute agreement of intentionality scores in the “random” condition (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI (0.93; 0.99),   P   < 0.0001) and the “theory of mind” condition (ICC = 0.96 95% CI (0.89; 0.98),   P   < 0.001) and absolute agreement of appropriateness scores in the “random” condition (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI (0.92; 0.99),   P   < 0.001) and the “theory of mind” condition (ICC = 0.96, 95% CI (0.91; 0.98),   P   < 0.001) among the two ratings. 


### fMRI paradigm 
  
To test for abnormal brain connectivity during social cognition, we used the social cognition paradigm from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) ( ) with permission from the WU-Minn HCP consortium (  http://www.humanconnectome.org/  ). Visual stimuli consist of animated sequences of 20 s duration showing geometric shapes (triangles, squares and circles) that move about in either a coordinated fashion that resembles a social interaction among individuals (social motion) or in a random fashion (non-social motion). Participants were presented with 10 sequences of social scenarios and 10 sequences of non-social scenarios in randomized order. After each stimulus sequence, participants were asked whether they had perceived a social interaction, answering ‘yes’ with their right index finger or ‘no’ with their right middle finger. The response period lasted 3 s. The paradigm was presented with E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.) and projected onto a screen at the back of the MRI bore that participants viewed through a mirror mounted on top of the radio frequency coil. Each block of stimulus and response was followed by 15 s of visual fixation (see  ).

### Ethics statement 
  
All participants received written and verbal information about the project and a written informed consent was obtained before inclusion. The study was approved by the Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics (Ref: 1–16-02–87-15) and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The project complied with the Helsinki-II-declaration. 


### fMRI acquisition 
  
T2*-weighted echo planar images (EPI) were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Magnetom Trio using a 32-channel RF head coil at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University, Denmark. Each volume consisted of 40 slices with 3 mm thickness acquired in descending order with repetition time (TR) = 2 sec, echo time (TE) = 27 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 192 × 192 mm and in-plane resolution = 64 × 64. The subjects’ head was fixated with soft cushions to minimize head movement during the experiment. 


### fMRI analysis 
  
fMRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12, revision 6906). Echo-planar (EPI) images were resampled to 2 mm  voxels, realigned within subject and spatially normalized to MNI space using the ICBM template of European brains. The time-series were high-pass filtered at 1/128 s using a discrete cosine set and temporal correlations were modelled using a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) model. Social and non-social motion conditions were modelled as boxcar regressors convolved with a canonical HRF and fitted to the BOLD time-series using a general linear model ( ). Visual fixation periods were not modelled and hence constituted an implicit baseline. Finally, the scan-to-scan realignment parameters (translations and rotations) were included in the GLM to adjust for the effects of head movement. Head movement did not differ between patients and healthy controls (RMS displacement:   F  (1, 47) = 0.54,   p   = 0.47). We created contrast images for each patient and control testing for visual motion in general (both social and non-social versus fixation) and the difference in activation between social and non-social stimuli. Finally, contrast images were smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and used as summary statistics in a random-effects analysis using one-sample   t  -tests within patients and controls, separately. To identify regions active both during the perception of visual motion in general and during social motion in particular, we used a conjunction analysis to test for a conjunction of   t  -tests (global null). This corresponds to masking one significant contrast with another to identify an overlap of significant activations ( ). We thus tested for visual motion in general (conjunction) and for social compared to non-social stimuli to identify effects in each group separately, differences between groups and, finally, commonalities across groups. All statistical tests were thresholded at   p   < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) whole-brain corrected for multiple comparisons using random field theory ( ). 


### Dynamic causal modelling of effective connectivity 
  
We used a two-state dynamic causal model (DCM) for fMRI (DCM12, revision 6755) to estimate the effective connectivity within and between brain areas, given observed haemodynamic measurements ( ). While one-state DCM for fMRI is used to model extrinsic connections only, two-state DCM models both extrinsic connections between regions as excitatory forward and backward connections and intrinsic connectivity within each region in terms of one inhibitory population and one excitatory population of neurons. This allows us to model the intrinsic connectivity within each cortical area as an increase or decrease in cortical inhibition ( ). We summarised the BOLD signal in each participant using the first eigenvariate (principal component) of voxels within a sphere of 8 mm radius centred on each participant’s local maximum. This subject-specific local maximum was identified within a sphere of 20 mm radius centred on the peak of the group effect. The network derived empirically from the group-level fMRI result comprised motion-sensitive area V5 and posterior superior temporal sulcus p(STS) in the right hemisphere (see  .). The hemodynamic responses to all visual motion (social and non-social stimuli) were mean-centred and modelled as a driving input to area V5 (C-matrix). Using parametric modulation of the regressor encoding all visual motion, the responses to social compared to non-social stimuli were modelled as a modulation (increase or decrease) of the intrinsic and extrinsic connection strengths (B-matrix) in relation to the average connectivity estimated from the mean-centred responses to all visual motion (A-matrix).

We analysed the intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity between V5 and pSTS under four alternative hypotheses (see   for a schematic). The first hypothesis was formulated as a full DCM where (1) both extrinsic connections between V5 and pSTS and intrinsic connections within V5 and pSTS encode the differences between experimental conditions. The second hypothesis was formulated as a reduced model where (2) only extrinsic connections between V5 and pSTS encode the differences between experimental conditions. The third hypothesis was formulated as a reduced model where (3) only the feedforward connection from V5 and pSTS encodes the differences between experimental conditions. Finally, a null model encoded the belief that (4) no connections change between conditions. 


### Bayesian model inversion 
  
We then inverted the full dynamic causal model encoding the first hypothesis for each patient and control using variational Laplace ( ). This provides both the posterior distribution of the connection strengths and the free-energy approximation to the marginal likelihood of the model itself, known as the model evidence. The free parameters and the Bayesian model evidence of each reduced model were then estimated using Bayesian model reduction under the Laplace assumption ( ). 

In variational Laplace, the conditional expectations and covariance of the (multivariate) approximate posterior distribution   are estimated iteratively by maximizing a lower bound on the logarithm of the model evidence  . This optimization uses Fisher scoring to maximize the (negative) variational free energy   of the model 

where   is the expectation under the approximate posterior density   and   is the Kullback-Leibner divergence between the approximate posterior and prior probability densities. To understand why the free energy is useful for model comparison, we can decompose it into accuracy and complexity terms. The accuracy is the expected log-likelihood of the data, given the model parameters, and scores the goodness-of-fit of a model. The complexity penalises models that overfit the data by favouring models with low posterior correlation among the parameters. In other words, the free energy penalizes models with high parameter redundancy. The formulation of the complexity as a KL divergence rests on the assumption that the posterior density should not have to move too far from the prior to accommodate the data. 


### Parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) analysis of group effects 
  
Having estimated the connection strengths and model evidence at the first level, we then used parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) to identify increases or decreases in connection strengths at the group level. PEB is a hierarchical Bayesian model in which empirical priors on the connection strengths at the single-subject level are estimated empirically using a Bayesian general linear model at the group level ( ). Unlike classical inference such as ANOVA, this hierarchical Bayesian model allows us to identify commonalities and differences in connection strengths at the group level, taking into account not only the mean of parameter estimates at the single-subject level, but also their variance. This means that subjects with more precise parameter estimates have greater influence on group-level parameters, whereas subjects whose parameters are surrounded by more uncertainty are down-weighted ( ). The advantage of parametric empirical Bayes is that it provides both the posterior distribution of the connection strengths at the group level and the marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence of the PEB model itself for Bayesian model comparison of alternative hypotheses. We then compared our alternative hypotheses using both random-effects Bayesian model selection ( ,  ) of dynamic causal models at the single-subject level and fixed-effects Bayesian model comparison of PEB-DCMs at the group level. 

Finally, we used Bayesian model comparison of PEB models to adjudicate between two alternative hypotheses about the relation between effective connectivity and clinical symptomatology using Bayesian linear regression. In this way, we are able to disambiguate between positive and negative symptoms as the best explanation of patient variability in synaptic efficacy. Normally, one would include medication dose for antipsychotics as a nuisance regressor in the regression model. However, given that all patients were newly diagnosed and did not yet receive standard antipsychotic treatment at a therapeutic level, conversion of their heterogeneous medication to standard chlorpromazine equivalents was not feasible ( ). Hence, we were not able to reliably adjust the regression models of positive and negative symptoms for standard doses of antipsychotics.

## Results 
  
### Demographics, psychopathology, intelligence, and social cognition 
  
Given that patients and controls were matched with regard to age, gender, educational level (last commenced education), and parental socioeconomic status (SES), we did not observe differences between groups in estimated IQ and, to our surprise, no differences in social cognition ( ). 


### Behavioural results of fMRI paradigm 
  
We first analysed response times within healthy controls and FES patients separately. Healthy controls were slower when judging social compared to non-social stimuli (  t  (24) = 2.26,   p   = 0.01, Cohen’s   d   = 0.41, two-tailed   t  -test). In contrast, FES patients showed no difference in response times when judging between social and non-social stimuli (  t  (23) = -0.35,   p   = 0.7, two-tailed   t  -test). We then compared response times between patients and healthy controls. There was no evidence of a difference between groups for social stimuli (  t  (47) = -0.25,   p   = 0.8, two-tailed   t  -test), nor for non-social stimuli (  t  (47) = -1.6,   p   = 0.1, two-tailed   t  -test). 

We then tested for a difference in task accuracy using McNemar’s   Chi  -test. This tests for a difference in proportions of accurately judged scenarios within each group separately. Neither healthy controls (  Chi  (1) = 1.08,   p   = 0.3), nor patients with schizophrenia (  Chi  (1) = 0.03,   p   = 0.9) showed evidence of a difference in judgment accuracy between social and non-social stimuli. We then tested for a difference in judgment accuracy between patients and controls using Pearson’s   Chi  -test. This revealed that healthy controls were more accurate in judging social motion than patients with schizophrenia (  Chi  (1) = 4.2,   p   = 0.04, Cramer’s   phi   = 0.09). In contrast, there was no evidence of a difference in accuracy between patients and controls when judging non-social motion (  Chi  (1) = 2,   p   = 0.2). 


### fMRI brain mapping in healthy controls 
  
When healthy controls perceived motion in general (social and non-social) they had increased activation in motion-sensitive area V5 in the right hemisphere with peak at MNI coordinate [44–70 −2],   T  (24) = 17.41,   P   < 0.0001, as well as V5 in the left hemisphere with peak at MNI coordinate [-44–72 −10],   T  (24) = 13.42,   P   < 0.0001. We also observed increased activation in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) with peak at MNI coordinate [-30–50 56],   T  (24) = 7.69,   P   < 0.0001. In contrast, when healthy controls perceived social motion compared to non-social motion, they had increased activation in posterior inferior temporal gyrus with peak at MNI coordinate [48–50 −18],   T  (24) = 11.40,   P   < 0.0001 and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) with peak at MNI coordinate [56–46 20],   T  (24) = 9.40,   P   < 0.0001 ( ).

### fMRI brain mapping in patients with first-episode schizophrenia 
  
When patients with first-episode schizophrenia perceived motion in general (social and non-social) they had increased activation in motion-sensitive area V5 in the right hemisphere with peak at MNI coordinate [38–80 4],   T  (23) = 13.40,   P   < 0.0001, as well as V5 in the left hemisphere with peak at MNI coordinate [-48–72 0],   T  (23) = 15.45,   P   < 0.0001. We also observed increased activation in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL) with peak at MNI coordinate [10–58 60],   T  (23) = 7.24,   P   < 0.0001. In contrast, when patients perceived social compared to non-social stimuli, they had increased activation in posterior inferior temporal gyrus with peak at MNI coordinate [46–52 −14],   T  (23) = 9.30,   P   < 0.0001 and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) with peak at MNI coordinate [54–42 12],   T  (23) = 8.05,   P   < 0.002. We also observed increased activation in area V4 in right inferior occipital gyrus with peak at MNI coordinate [30–92 −2],   T  (23) = 10.96,   P   < 0.0001. There were no differences in BOLD amplitude between patients and controls at a standard family-wise error rate of   P   < 0.05 ( ). 


### Brain mapping commonalities among patients and controls 
  
We then used a conjunction analysis to identify regions active both during the perception of visual motion in general (social and non-social) as well as during social motion in particular (social minus non-social) in both patients and controls. This revealed two main clusters in the right hemisphere centred on motion-sensitive area V5 and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) summarized in  . Importantly, the activation of the pSTS during social motion conforms to the anatomical findings in the literature ( ). The time-series in these two regions, common to both patients and controls, were then used for dynamic causal modelling. 


### Effective connectivity between V5 and pSTS in healthy controls 
  
Using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) and parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we analysed the strength of extrinsic connectivity between V5 and pSTS in the right hemisphere, as well as inhibitory connectivity within each area. While the responses to motion in general were modelled as a driving input to V5, the responses to social versus non-social stimuli were modelled as a modulation (increase or decrease) of the intrinsic and extrinsic connection strengths and hence constituted the experimental effects-of-interest. Random-effects Bayesian model comparison of DCMs ( ) revealed that the cortical network with changes in both extrinsic and intrinsic connections had the highest posterior probability in healthy controls (Posterior model probability > 0.85 and protected exceedance probability > 0.99). This was confirmed by a Bayesian model comparison of the PEB models at the group level (Posterior model probability > 0.99). Within this network, healthy controls had an increase in feedforward connectivity from V5 to pSTS (Posterior probability > 0.99) and a decrease in feedback connectivity (Posterior probability > 0.99). At the same time, there was a decrease in intrinsic (inhibitory) coupling within V5 (Posterior probability > 0.99) and a concomitant increase in intrinsic (inhibitory) coupling within pSTS (Posterior probability > 0.99) ( ).

### Aberrant effective connectivity in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls 
  
Using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we then tested for differences in the strength of extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Again, random-effects Bayesian model comparison of DCMs ( ) revealed that the full model had the highest posterior probability across patients and controls (Posterior probability > 0.89 and protected exceedance probability > 0.999). This was confirmed by a Bayesian model comparison of PEB models at the group level (Posterior probability > 0.99). Within this network, patients had increased feedforward connectivity when they perceived social stimuli compared to the healthy controls (Posterior probability > 0.97) ( ). 


### Patients with stronger positive symptoms have more disinhibition within pSTS 
  
We then tested for an association between psychopathology and effective connectivity in patients during social stimuli compared to non-social stimuli. Using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we compared the model evidence of a PEB-DCM with connection strengths explained by positive symptoms to the model evidence of a PEB-DCM explained by negative symptoms. Bayesian model comparison showed that between-patient differences in effective connectivity were better explained by their positive symptoms than by their negative symptoms. Inspection of the PEB model revealed that patients who reported a higher degree of positive symptoms had reduced intrinsic (inhibitory) coupling within a dynamic causal model of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (Posterior probability > 0.99). In other words, patients with more positive symptoms had more disinhibition within posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) ( ).

## Discussion 
  
### High-functioning FES patients have aberrant brain connectivity 
  
In this study, we used DCM for fMRI to test for differences in effective connectivity between patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy matched controls during the HCP social cognition paradigm ( ). This allowed us to identify pathophysiological differences in the feedforward and intrinsic connectivity in patients compared to controls. The behavioral results summarized in   suggest that these first-episode patients were high-functioning in relation to previous studies, where patients with schizophrenia typically performed 1–2 standard deviations below healthy controls on cognitive and social cognition tasks ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). This might be due to a short duration of illness, combined with a successful match of FES patients and controls. Despite their high level of functioning, our DCM results show aberrant brain connectivity in relation to healthy matched controls. Moreover, our results point to an association between cortical inhibition within the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the severity of positive symptoms in first-episode patients. Recent studies have shown differences in pSTS activation and functional connectivity with prefrontal cortex between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls during different social perception paradigms ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). In line with our finding, Backash et al. showed an association between pSTS activation and delusional (positive) symptoms ( ). However, in contrast to these previous studies, we show an association between psychopathology and brain function using a biophysical model of the underlying neuronal activity, as opposed to the level of observed BOLD responses. 


### Active inference and failures of social inference 
  
Computational theories of the brain that describe neuronal connectivity as a process of Bayesian inference are becoming increasingly useful for a mechanistic understanding of perception and action ( ). In the context of social cognition, active inference offers a natural way to understand theory of mind as inferring the hidden states of another agent’s intentions, given their observed behavior ( ). Crucially, this inference rests on a generative model of the mental states that cause a particular social behavior. For an agent to successfully engage in social communication, this generative model must be able to account for both the social behavior of other agents and one’s own behavior. In other word, one must model the behavior caused by other agents and the behavior caused by oneself and as being generated by the same model of intentions ( ). We here provide an account of abnormal social cognition in terms of aberrant encoding of precision within a generative model of intentions or mental states. 

In active inference, perception corresponds to inferring the hidden states in the world that cause sensory observations. These states are hidden in the sense that the world can only be observed through noisy sensory inputs. In order to infer the (hidden) mental states of other agents that cause a particular social behavior, the brain must have a generative model that combines prior beliefs about plausible mental states with the likelihood of observing a particular behavior to form posterior beliefs (theory of mind). These probabilistic beliefs are encoded in terms of their expectation and precision. Precision is simply the inverse variance or uncertainty with which the brain represents the external world. It follows from the form of this generative model that the brain must minimize the surprise   about sensory observations   at any one time, given a particular model   m   or explanation of those sensations. However, as computing surprise itself is mathematically intractable, a plausible solution is that the brain minimizes an upper bound on surprise known as variational free energy ( ). 

Feedback connections are thought to encode an agent’s internal predictions about hidden states in the external world, such as one’s beliefs about the mental states of other agents that constitute theory of mind ( ). By contrast, feedforward connections mediate the ensuing prediction errors that are inconsistent with these predictions, given current sensory observations. The key imperative of active inference is to reduce uncertainty within the brain’s generative model of the world by actively sampling parts of the sensorium that require sensory interrogation ( ). When exposed to social stimuli, the influence of prediction errors on posterior beliefs (social inference) is controlled by their relative precision or confidence. Our results show that patients were less accurate in detecting social scenarios than healthy controls. At the same time, patients had increased feedforward connectivity from V5 to pSTS during these social stimuli compared to controls. This increased level of feedforward connectivity may be compensatory in nature and reflect a state where prediction errors are weighted by an abnormally high level of precision during visual stimuli. This fits well with theories proposing that schizophrenia is associated with abnormally high levels of prediction error during perceptual inference ( ). Our interpretation is that there is a failure to integrate the social information carried by prediction errors into a patient’s generative model of mental states that constitutes their theory of mind. In other words, there is an impairment in the way sensory information used to resolve uncertainty about the world during active sampling. Psychologically, this failure to resolve uncertainty about the world would result in a misinterpretation of social cues that may be understood as hypo-mentalizing ( ). This interpretation is entirely supported by our finding that patients were less accurate in detecting social scenarios than healthy controls. 

Neurobiologically, a developmental dysfunction of synaptic efficacy has been proposed as a likely disease mechanism in schizophrenia ( ). Specifically, a dysfunction of the glutamatergic   N  -methyl-  D  -aspartate (NMDA) receptor expressed at both excitatory pyramidal cells and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons ( ) has been proposed to play a central role in the generation of perceptual, cognitive and psychotic symptoms ( ,  ,  ,  ). Evidence from non-invasive electrophysiology in humans has been reported by Schmidt et al. who observed an increase in feedforward connectivity within the auditory system ( ) and Rosch et al. who observed a selective disinhibition within the superior temporal gyrus, both under NMDA-receptor blockade with ketamine ( ). Similar findings under pharmacological manipulation of NMDA-receptor function have been linked to psychosis ( ,  ,  ). Finally, Backash et al. who showed an association between pSTS activation and delusional (positive) symptoms ( ). Our finding of more disinhibition within pSTS in patients with positive symptoms concurs with these studies and adds to the evidence that psychosis may associated with an abnormal balance of excitation and inhibition ( ,  ). 


### Replicability and future research 
  
Our reasons for using the HCP social cognition paradigm are twofold. First, it allowed us to replicate previous findings in the typical brain ( ) using the exact same paradigm. Replicability in the normal population is valuable because it adds to the construct validity of our findings. Second, it allowed us to test for aberrant pathophysiology in a patient cohort using a standardized paradigm. Sharing of standardized stimulus paradigms and data analysis pipelines is essential for the replicability of neuroimaging findings in new datasets from both healthy and clinical cohorts across independent research sites. We are currently planning more research integrating fMRI with MEG and EEG in order to identify both differences and commonalities in pathophysiology across different subgroups of patients with schizophrenia, ranging from children at genetic risk of developing schizophrenia to first-episode patients.

<h3>Screening Results</h3>
<p><strong>Fulltext Decision:</strong> included</p>
<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study meets all inclusion criteria: it uses task-based fMRI in healthy adult participants (n=19, ages 18–58). The task probes social communication/perception (production and perception of prosody, emotional intonation) and relates neural activity to empathy—clearly social-related processing. Group-level, whole-brain univariate analyses are reported (random-effects contrasts such as “happy–neutral” and “question–neutral”; thresholds reported p<0.05 FDR, k>5; additional voxelwise contrasts and coordinate lists referenced in supplementary materials). Analyses are not limited to ROIs or connectivity; healthy-group whole-brain task activation maps are explicitly described and used for inference. No exclusion criteria (e.g., only ROI/connectivity, non-healthy sample, out-of-age-range) are violated. Therefore the paper should be included.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
## Background 
  
Prosody, the melody and intonation of speech, involves the rhythm, rate, pitch and voice quality to relay linguistic and emotional information from one individual to another. A significant component of human social communication depends upon interpreting and responding to another person's prosodic tone as well as one's own ability to produce prosodic speech. However there has been little work on whether the perception and production of prosody share common neural processes, and if so, how these might correlate with individual differences in social ability. 


## Methods 
  
The aim of the present study was to determine the degree to which perception and production of prosody rely on shared neural systems. Using fMRI, neural activity during perception and production of a meaningless phrase in different prosodic intonations was measured. Regions of overlap for production and perception of prosody were found in premotor regions, in particular the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Activity in these regions was further found to correlate with how high an individual scored on two different measures of affective empathy as well as a measure on prosodic production ability. 


## Conclusions 
  
These data indicate, for the first time, that areas that are important for prosody production may also be utilized for prosody perception, as well as other aspects of social communication and social understanding, such as aspects of empathy and prosodic ability.

## Introduction 
  
Prosody, the melody and intonation of speech, involves the rhythm, rate, pitch and voice quality to relay linguistic and emotional information from one individual to another. A significant component of human social communication depends upon interpreting and responding to another person's prosodic tone as well as one's own ability to produce prosodic speech. However there has been little work on whether the perception and production of prosody share common neural processes, and if so, how these might correlate with individual differences in social ability. 

The   production   of prosody is well known to be a specialization of the premotor cortex, in particular the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), with emotional prosody more strongly activating the right hemisphere and linguistic prosody more strongly activating the left hemisphere  ,  . Research on the   perception   of prosody has largely focused on the right temporal lobe. However, despite this emphasis, there is some indication that the premotor cortex may also be involved  ,  ,  . Nevertheless, premotor contributions to prosody perception have not been well studied. 

There is limited evidence that there may be common frontal areas active for both the perception and production of prosody; patients with lesions to frontal areas seem to have difficulty with both the perception and production of prosody  . However, these lesions are often very large and it is difficult to discern if the same brain areas are utilized in the two tasks. If the same areas were to be involved, it may indicate that, at least under some circumstances, the acoustic signals from another person's prosodic speech are transformed into articulatory signals in order to understand prosodic meaning. That is, it may imply that in order to understand someone else's prosodic intonation, we may utilize our own motor representations of how we would produce the given intonation. 

Indeed, there is a growing body of data indicating that premotor areas are sensitive to the sounds of actions  – . This activation is somatotopic, such that the sounds of hand actions activate the hand premotor areas and the sounds of mouth actions activate the mouth premotor areas  . The finding that regions in motor-related cortices are active for both the production and perception of a particular action is commonly referred to as “mirror system” activation. This data has also been extended for speech perception, showing that premotor mouth areas involved in producing speech are also involved in perceiving speech  ,  . The latter data indicate that motor areas may be involved in the processing of speech, particularly in noisy environments like the fMRI scanner room  . The current research investigates whether a similar pattern could be found for prosody. It also extends the findings of the auditory mirror system to include processing that is relevant to social and emotional information  . 

Furthermore, there is evidence that activity in premotor areas that respond to the sounds of actions correlates with one's ability to empathize with others  . This finding supports the idea that mapping the perception of other people's actions onto one's own motor representations (simulation) may be an important aspect of empathy. There is also evidence that individuals who score low on measures of empathy (as in psychopathic personality as well as autism) have poor prosodic ability  . Investigating the role of prosodic ability and its neural processes has clinical implications in clarifying the role of affective deficits in psychopathy. For this reason, we are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between prosody, empathy, and the mirror system. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty right-handed, native-English speaking volunteers with no history of neurological or psychiatric conditions participated in the experiment. One subject was eliminated from all analyses due to technical errors, bringing the total to 19 subjects (13 females; 18–58 range, mean 28.1). All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing. All assessments were made by screening questionnaires and all subjects gave informed written consent. Human subjects approval for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Southern California. 


### Stimuli and Task Procedures 
  
The main goal of the study is to determine if there are common regions for the production and perception of prosody. For this reason, the functional imaging component of the experiment consisted of two tasks, one to investigate prosody production and another to investigate prosody perception. Half of the subjects performed the production task runs first, while the other half performed the perception task first. Subjects were trained on the tasks prior to scanning. 

#### Production task 
  
Nonsense syllables were used to reduce/exclude additional linguistic processing (e.g., syntax, semantics)  . Subjects were asked to produce the phrase “da da da da da” in different intonations: happy, sad, question, and neutral. Participants were also instructed to produce no speech on some trials (rest condition). Note that our control condition, “neutral” intonation, will still contain intonation, as a flat pitch profile is still a pitch profile. However, it should nevertheless contain less prosodic information than the other conditions. Subjects were presented with a visual cue at the onset of each trial. A line drawing of a face was used to cue the participant to produce one of five task conditions (happy, sad, question, neutral, rest). As   shows, the mouth of the line drawing varied for each cue (smile, frown, question mark for question, straight line for neutral, and X for rest). The visual cue was presented on the screen for 1 s followed by a gray screen and subjects were asked to produce speech as soon as the gray screen appeared. Subjects were trained prior to scanning to produce speech in a tone of voice that matched the presented visual cue. Each seven and a half minute functional run consisted of ten trials of each condition (including rest) for a total of 50 trials, and each subject performed three functional runs of the production task (30 trials per condition total). Participants' performance during the production task were monitored by an experimenter via headphones and recorded through an fMRI-safe microphone and digital voice recorder. Prior testing of the recording setup indicated that while the quality of the recordings were affected by the MRI background noise and conduction through the tubing, these degradations were minimal and did not affect subsequent analyses of voice data. A further concern when subjects produce speech is the possibility for motion artifacts. Our design minimized movement artifact by training subjects prior to scanning to move their heads minimally while producing speech, by using phrases that require minimal jaw movement (e.g.,“da”), and by using other sophisticated motion correction techniques (e.g., an on-line acquisition correction technique during scanning, and use of motion parameters as regressors in the analyses). 
   Schematic of the prosody production task design.  
A visual cue is presented 1 s, followed by 8 s of blank screen. Acquisition of functional volumes occurred during the last 2 s of the blank screen. The conditions were “happy”, “sad”, “question”, “neutral” (not shown in figure), and “rest”. The presentation order of the conditions was randomized for each subject. 
  

#### Perception task 
  
The perception task had the identical design as the production task except for the stimuli; no visual stimuli were presented. Instead, each trial began with a delay of 1 s followed by an auditory stimulus of duration 2 s. The auditory stimuli consisted of voice recordings (“da-da-da-da-da” recorded by an actress) that depicted the conditions happy, sad, question, and neutral. As in the production task, nonsense syllables were chosen to minimize effects of semantics and syntax. Subjects were instructed to listen to the auditory stimulus and to especially attend to the intonation of the voice. All auditory stimuli were pre-tested prior to the experiment. As in the production task, each seven and a half minute functional run consisted of 10 trials of each condition, plus 10 trials where no auditory stimulus was delivered (rest trials), for a total of 50 trials. Each subject performed three functional runs of the perception task (30 trials per condition total). 



### Image Acquisition 
  
Functional MRI images were acquired with a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3T machine. In order to ensure that participants could hear the auditory stimuli during the perception task and that we could take audible voice samples during scanning of the production task, we used a sparse sampling paradigm throughout the experiment  ,  . In this paradigm, we minimized scanner noise by acquiring one volume 6 s after event onset to capture the peak of the hemodynamic response to the stimulus  . In the production task, volumes were acquired 6 s after the offset of the visual cue (which was approximately the onset of the subjects' speech production); in the perception task, functional acquisitions occurred 6 s following stimulus onset. Functional volumes were acquired with a echo planar T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence (TR = 9000 ms; TA = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; 192 mm FoV; 64×64 voxel matrix; 29 axial slices (interleaved); 3×3×4.5 mm voxels, no gap). A high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan (MPRAGE; TR = 1950 ms; TE = 2.56 ms; flip angle = 90°; 256 mm FoV; 256×256 voxel matrix; 208 coronal slices; 1×1×1 mm voxels) as well as a T1-weighted structural scan with the same slice prescription as the functional images (coplanar; TR = 702 ms; TE = 17 ms; flip angle = 55°; FoV = 192 mm; 192×192 voxel matrix; 29 axial slices; 1×1×4.5 mm voxels) were also acquired from all subjects. Acquisition of functional volumes employed Siemens' prospective acquisition correction (PACE) technique for motion correction, in which head movements are calculated by comparing successively acquired volumes and are corrected on-line  ,  . 


### Image Processing 
  
Functional images were preprocessed and analyzed with SPM2 software (  www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/  ; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). Images were corrected for slice timing and then normalized to MNI space (using the EPI.mnc template) to allow across-subject comparisons. Motion parameters were calculated for the functional images. Images were then un-warped using the motion parameters and then spatially smoothed with a 7.5 mm Gaussian filter. In each task (production and perception), each condition (happy, sad, question, neutral, rest) was estimated with a Finite Impulse Response, and motion parameters were added to the design matrix as nuisance variables to minimize the effects of head movements during scanning. Scans were excluded from analysis if translational motion greater than 3 mm was detected; no participant exceeded this amount of translational motion. The finite impulse response model was used because our sparse sampling paradigm made it impossible for us to model the entire length/shape of the hemodynamic response function, and thus we needed to analyze each trial/volume as an impulse function. T-contrasts were computed to observe differences between conditions. Group analyses were performed using random effects models with contrast estimates from individual subjects and were thresholded at p<0.05 (FDR multiple comparisons correction) with a minimum cluster size of 5 contiguous voxels. 

#### Task-related activity for prosody 
  
To observe brain regions involved in the processing of prosody, we performed the contrasts “happy-neutral” and “question-neutral”. These contrasts were performed for the production and the perception task separately. The “happy-neutral” and contrast will reveal brain regions involved in emotional prosody processing, while the “question-neutral” contrast will reveal brain regions involved in linguistic prosody processing. The “sad” condition was not used in this analysis because 1) “happy” and “sad” emotions may be processed differently (e.g., Davidson's Approach-Withdrawal Hypothesis  ); 2) if “sad” were included, then the “emotional” and “linguistic” prosody tasks will not be balanced; 3) acoustical analysis indicated that “sad” is more similar to the neutral prosody condition than the “happy” condition, and different from both “happy” and “question” conditions (see supplementary materials,  ). Thus omitting the “sad” condition from this analysis allows us to maximize the difference between our control condition and question prosody condition. 


#### Common regions for perception and production of prosody 
  
To determine brain regions involved in both the production and the perception of emotional prosody, we observed whether regions associated with emotional prosody production were also active during emotional prosody perception. The same procedure was applied for linguistic prosody production and perception. We first obtained a thresholded map for the production task contrast (“happy-neutral” for emotional prosody; “question-neutral” for linguistic prosody; p<0.05, FDR, k>5). Individual clusters from the thresholded production contrast maps were then used as masks to determine whether prosody perception also activated voxels within those regions. These masks were then used to apply small volume correction (SVC) to the corresponding prosody perception contrasts. 



### Behavioral Measures 
  
We were further interested in how activity in brain areas involved in prosody production/perception may correlate with an individual's ability to produce or perceive prosody. Furthermore, because of the relationship between prosody perception and empathy described in clinical literature  , we were also interested in finding a correlation between brain regions active during prosody perception and an individual's scores on measures of affective empathy. Thus, in addition to the fMRI experiment, we also administered questionnaires to our participants outside of the scanner in order to obtain measures of prosody ability and empathy. These measures were used to correlate prosodic ability to empathy as well as with the functional activations during the fMRI experiment. 

#### Assessment of prosodic ability 
  
To assess prosody   production   ability, two raters subjectively scored the voice recordings taken from participants during the fMRI production task on the level of expression of a subset of the trials. The scoring was performed after the scanning session. A 5-point Likert scale was used to judge prosodic ability, with “1” corresponding with “could not determine intended condition”, to “5” corresponding with “could absolutely determine intended condition; superb expression.” Three randomly selected “happy” and “sad” trials from each scanning run were scored, and average scores for “happy”, “sad”, and “happy&sad” were obtained for each subject. To assess prosody   perception   ability, we administered a separate questionnaire where subjects listened to 28 audio clips depicting the conditions happy, sad, question, and neutral, and were to determine the four conditions each clip belonged to. An accuracy score of the proportion of correctly determined clips was obtained for each subject as a measure of how well a person can distinguish between different prosody conditions. 


#### Assessment of empathy 
  
To obtain a measure of empathy in our subjects, we administered two questionnaires: the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)   and the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R)  . The IRI, a self-report measure assessing specific dimensions of empathy, consists of 4 subscales, each measuring a unique component of empathy. As our aim was to correlate emotional aspects of empathy with individual ability to perceive emotional prosody, we focused on the component of the IRI thought to reflect an affective component of empathy, Personal Distress (PD; e.g., “When I see someone who badly needs help in an emergency, I go to pieces”  . The other subscales of the IRI are Fantasy Scale (FS), Empathic Concern (EC), and Perspective Taking (PT). EC is another form of affective empathy, while FS and PT are considered to be cognitive forms of empathy. These subscales were not included in the hypotheses. The PPI-R also consists of multiple subscales and factors, each representing some psychopathic personality trait. The affective component of psychopathic personality has generally been thought to be inversely related to empathy; individuals who exhibit psychopathic personality traits and show symptoms of antisocial personality disorder are also likely to show callousness and a lack of empathy  ,  . Specifically, the Coldheartedness scale (C) of the PPI-R reflects a propensity toward callousness, guiltlessness, and lack of sentimentality, and is related to a lack of affective empathy. Thus, the PPI-R Coldheartedness scale was used as an additional measure of affective empathy, and we predicted that it would negatively correlate with prosody perception. 



### Correlations between Prosody Perception and Empathy 
  
#### Behavioral 
  
To determine whether an individual's ability to perceive prosody is related to their empathy, we performed correlations between subjects' scores on the prosody perception questionnaire and empathy scores. Once again we focused on components of empathy and performed correlation analyses using subscales that relate specifically to affective empathy, the Personal Distress scale of the IRI and the Coldheartedness scale of the PPI-R. 


#### fMRI 
  
To determine prosody-related brain regions whose activity correlates with prosody perception and empathy ability, we ran simple regression models at the group level for the contrast “happy&sad-neutral” using individuals' empathy scores as regressors. To observe which brain regions show a linear relationship to empathy, contrast estimates of “happy&sad-neutral” perception were correlated with PD scores from the IRI and C scores from the PPI-R to elucidate correlations between affective empathy and neural activity during emotional prosody perception. These analyses were thresholded at p<0.005 uncorrected with a cluster threshold of k>5 voxels. Both the “happy” and “sad” conditions were included in this analysis as we posited that the neural systems involved in perceive both these intonations was related to empathic ability. 



### Prosody Production Ability Correlated with Emotional Prosody Production 
  
Do individuals who are better at producing prosody show more activity in motor regions involved in prosody production? To investigate this we correlated areas that were active for emotional prosody production with the behavioral measure of prosody production ability. To observe which brain regions show a linear relationship to prosody production ability (i.e., the voice production ratings), we correlated each subject's “happy&sad-neutral” production task contrast estimates with their voice ratings. 



## Results 
  
### Task-Related Activity for Prosody 
  
#### Emotional prosody production 
  
The contrast “happy-neutral” for the production task revealed activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior middle temporal gyri, bilateral lingual gyri, left cuneus, right midbrain, right fusiform gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral thalami, left superior frontal gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, left middle cingulate gyrus, right caudate, right insula, left anterior superior medial gyrus, and bilateral posterior superior medial gyri (p<0.05, FDR, k>5). A complete list of results is available in the supplementary materials ( ). In addition, a whole-brain contrast against rest is shown in   and against control in  . Regions specifically involved in emotional prosody perception as compared to control are shown in  . 


#### Linguistic prosody production 
  
The contrast “question-neutral” for the production task revealed widespread activations across many regions, including portions of the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri bilaterally, the supplementary motor area, medial regions of the parietal and occipital cortices, the lingual gyri bilaterally, portions of the left insula, posterior regions of the middle temporal gyri bilaterally, the left superior temporal gyrus, and portions of the anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.05, FDR, k>5. A complete list of results is available in the supplementary materials ( ). In addition, a whole-brain contrast against rest is shown in   and against control in  . Regions specifically involved in linguistic prosody perception as compared to control are shown in  . 



### Shared Networks for Emotional Prosody 
  
In order to determine whether brain regions active while producing emotional prosody were also active when perceiving emotional prosody, we created masks from the thresholded production contrast “happy-neutral”, and observed whether these regions were also active in perception. Masks from the production contrast were used to perform small volume corrections to the perception contrast “happy-neutral”. As predicted, motor related regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis; BA44) and the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6; dorsal premotor cortex) were significantly active. The left middle cingulate gyrus, right caudate, and right thalamus also survived SVC (p<0.05, FWE, k>5) ( ).

Red = Emotional prosody production regions (p<0.05, FDR; T>3.48) that were also active for perception (p<0.05, FDR (SVC); T>2.38). Green = Linguistic prosody production regions (p<0.05, FDR; T>3.80) that were also active for perception (p<0.05, FDR (SVC); T>2.45). A region in the left inferior frontal gyrus appears to be involved for the production and perception of both emotional and linguistic prosody. 
  

### Shared Networks for Linguistic Prosody 
  
We further predicted that motor-related regions would be commonly active for the perception and production of linguistic prosody. In support of our hypothesis, motor-related regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis; BA44) and left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6; dorsal premotor cortex) and bilateral superior frontal gyri (BA 6) were active for both tasks. The left anterior cingulate cortex and left insula also survived SVC (p<0.05, FWE, k>5) ( ). 


### Behavioral Results 
  
#### Empathy scales 
  
 IRI  . All 19 subjects completed the IRI. The mean scores (and standard deviations) for each subscale are as follows: FS = 19.21 (5); EC = 18.63 (4.7); PD = 8.58 (5.31); PT = 18.26 (5.94). These values are similar to those originally reported by Davis (1980) and are within two standard deviations of the normed mean.   PPI-R  . One subject did not complete the PPI-R due to experimental difficulties; one participant reported 2 standard deviations above the mean and the remaining 17 participants scored within normal range (+/− 1.5 SD) (mean = 29.16; std = 6.33). As the PPI was originally normed on a college population, our patterns reflect the normal bell curve expected for this measure. 


#### Correlations between prosody perception ability and empathy 
  
As expected, correlations between behavioral measures of prosody and empathy revealed significant results for the PD scale of the IRI and for the C scale of the PPI-R. The PD scale correlated positively with performance on the prosody perception task (r = 0.46; R-sq = 0.21; p(one-tailed) <0.0287). This finding is consistent with our prediction that prosody perception ability will be related with affective empathy. The C scale was found to correlate negatively with performance on the prosody perception task (r = −0.47; R-sq = 0.22; p(one-tailed) <0.0297). Because the C scale is an indicator of deficits in affective empathy, the finding of a negative correlation between C scale scores with prosody perception is expected. It should be noted that in future studies, larger sample sizes would be more optimal in testing these scales, and further allow for more stringent analyses to test the hypotheses. Graphs of performance and production scores are shown in   and scatter plots for these correlations are shown in  . 



### Affective Empathy Scores Correlated with Emotional Prosody Perception: fMRI Results 
  
A correlation analysis between individual differences in the PD score from the IRI and contrast estimates during emotional prosody perception indicates regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) and right cerebellum as showing activity that positively correlates with PD scores (p<0.005; uncorrected, k>5) ( ). The R-sq for the left IFG is 0.42 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.12–0.73. 
   Regions involved in emotional prosody perception correlated with empathy.

For the PPI-R, higher scores in the cold-heartedness scale (C) indicate deficits in empathic ability. Thus here we focused on a negative correlation with the C score and neural activity during emotional prosody perception. A correlation analysis between individual differences in the C score from the PPI-R and contrast estimates during emotional prosody perception indicates regions in the frontal cortex, including bilateral superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, bilateral cingulate sulcus, bilateral anterior insula, bilateral transverse temporal gyrus (Heschl's gyrus), bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and right TPJ show activity that negatively correlates with C score (p<0.005; uncorrected, k>5) ( ). The R-sq for a region within the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) is 0.54 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.26–0.92. While the results reported here support our hypotheses, it should be noted that larger sample sizes would greatly reinforce this finding, and would better allow for effects to be tested with more stringent tests. 

Further post-hoc analyses in the perception/IRI and perception/PPI-R analyses, indicate that the correlations are driven in part by processing of neutral stimuli. Whereas we report a positive correlation in the left inferior frontal sulcus between PD score (IRI) and the “happy&sad - neutral” contrast, this correlation is influenced by a negative correlation between activity during “neutral” and PD score. Likewise, in the left inferior frontal gyrus (L IFG), we report a strong negative correlation between the Coldheartedness score (C; PPI-R) and the “happy&sad - neutral” contrast. This correlation is also in part influenced by a positive correlation between C score and “neutral” activity. 


### Prosody Production Ability Correlated with Emotional Prosody Production 
  
A linear regression between individual differences in prosody production ability and contrast estimates during emotional prosody production indicates motor-related regions in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), the left superior frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus to be positively correlated to prosody production ability (p<0.005; uncorrected,  ), although this result did not meet the cluster threshold of k>5 voxels. The R-squared for this result is 0.36 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.04–0.67. 



## Discussion 
  
### Common Brain Regions for the Production and Perception of Prosody 
  
We found areas in the premotor cortex, including the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left dorsal premotor cortex were active for both the perception and production of prosody. This was true for both emotional prosody and linguistic prosody. These results are consistent with previous findings of activity in premotor regions during prosody perception  ,  . The current result indicates a link between perception and production, where brain areas that are commonly thought to be involved with motor planning are also active for perception. While there have been numerous previous reports of perceptual processing in motor areas for action observation  – , for the sounds of actions  ,  , and even for speech  , to our knowledge this is the first report of “mirror” processing for prosody. It may indicate that some components of prosodic perception involve mapping the heard speech to areas that are important for producing that same speech. Such mapping of acoustic signals to articulatory signals is reminiscent of the motor theory of speech perception  . This finding is also in line with the proposed “‘as-if’ body loop” where individuals utilize sensory-motor regions to implicitly simulate perceived or imagined experiences  , as well as other studies that indicate that frontal regions are involved in prosodic perception  ,  ,  ,  . While we do not state that this is the only way that prosodic perceptual processing occurs (and clearly other regions are found to be active when just comparing prosody perception to control), activity in the premotor regions might contribute to the processing more or less strongly in particular circumstances, such as in subtle or more ambiguous instances  . Indeed, the topic of motor contributions to speech processing has been a subject of great debate  ,  , and we take the view that motor contributions to speech processing are one several processing strategies that may be utilized, depending on speech context (e.g., noisy/quiet)   and the task demands. 

The inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortices are known to have connections to auditory areas, in particular though the arcuate fasciculus  . This “dorsal stream” of speech perception from auditory regions to inferior frontal regions may provide a sensory-motor interface that is important for mapping perceived speech onto articulatory processes  ,  . Thus, inferior frontal areas have the possibility for auditory and motor processing, and in fact are known to respond to the sounds of a variety of hand and mouth actions  . In the case of prosody, we hear our own prosody as we produce it. With time, co-activation of production and perception, through Hebbian learning, could strengthen the activity in multimodal premotor areas to either the afferent or efferent component of the speech, thus producing the areas that we find in this study to be active for both perception and production of prosodic speech. 

Interestingly, our data indicate that common motor areas for production and perception of prosody were found in only the left hemisphere (left IFG and premotor cortices). This was true for both linguistic and emotional prosody. Thus, while emotional prosody perception and also prosody production are known to activate the right hemisphere each  , “mirror” regions for prosody seem to be stronger in the left hemisphere. This is consistent with all previous reports of an auditory mirror system as being lateralized to the left hemisphere  ,  , and may indicate a special role in the left premotor cortex for more multimodal processing (motor, visual, and auditory), while the right equivalent areas instead may be stronger in motor and visual properties rather than auditory properties. 

One possible limitation in this analysis is the possibility that participants implicitly made facial movements during perception trials. Outside the scanner, electromyographic recordings were taken from some subjects to test this possibility, and these results of this analysis, indicating a lack of facial muscle movement during perception trials, are included in the supplementary materials ( ). However it should be noted that any study on perception is limited by the possibility of implicit movement unless measured directly inside the scanning session. 


### Correlations with Affective Empathy 
  
Prosodic ability is known to correlate with deficits associated with affective components of empathic processing. This is best observed in individuals with psychopathy. These individuals, who often score low on emotional aspects of empathy, also tend to score poorly on the ability to perceive prosody  . Our behavioral results further support a positive correlation between ability to perceive prosody and ability to feel emotional aspects of empathy, constructs measured by the PPI-R scale of cold-heartedness (C) and the IRI scale of personal distress (PD). Thus we also looked at individual differences in emotional components of empathy [lower scores on (C) measure on the PPI-R, and personal distress (PD) measure on the IRI], and correlated these with areas that were active for the perception of emotional prosody. We found that individuals who scored higher on these measures of empathy showed more activity during emotional prosody perception in anatomically the same premotor areas that we previously found to be active for the perception and production of prosody, including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortex. They also were found to show less activity in this region during neutral prosodic intonation, indicating that more empathic individuals utilize premotor regions for emotional prosodic perception, but less for non-emotional stimuli. This data support the notion that components of empathy to emotional stimuli may rely on simulation processes carried out, in part, by motor-related areas  ,  . Thus, in order to understand someone else's prosodic intonation, we may simulate how we would produce the given intonation ourselves, which in turn may be a component of the process involved in creating empathic feeling for that individual. These data indicate that individuals who score higher on scales of affective empathy also show more activity in motor-related areas during prosody perception. Our findings extend previous correlations between the mirror neuron system and individual differences in empathy to include, for the first time, an emotional auditory stimulus: happy or sad prosodic intonation. 

The negative correlation with the C score showed additional areas in the left anterior insula and the superior temporal gyrus. The insula activation might indicate more emotional processing when perceiving emotional stimuli by individuals who are more empathic. Activity in temporal areas may indicate that individuals who are more empathic might also initially process the perceived intonation more than other individuals as well. It is interesting to note that the motor-related activations are bilateral while the temporal activations are observed only in the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere temporal activations are consistent with previous studies of prosody perception; however the motor activities are instead consistent with the bilateral control of the mouth muscles, important for prosody production (see supplementary materials,  ). 


### Correlations with Prosodic Ability 
  
Correlations between behavioral measures of prosody production ability and brain regions that are active during prosody production indicate that individuals who are better at producing prosody activate areas important for motor planning of prosody more than individuals that are poor at prosody production. Because here we focus on affective prosody production alone, we find activity predominately in the right hemisphere, as one would expect. While such a finding has been found for other areas of motor expertise  , this is the first time we find such an effect for aspects of non-verbal aspects of language processing. A similar correlation for prosody perception, while interesting, was not possible due to a ceiling effect on the behavioral measures of perception ability; an abnormal population may be more relevant for such a correlation.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Autism is a psychiatric/neurological condition in which alterations in social interaction (among other symptoms) are diagnosed by behavioral psychiatric methods. The main goal of this study was to determine how the neural representations and meanings of social concepts (such as   to insult  ) are altered in autism. A second goal was to determine whether these alterations can serve as neurocognitive markers of autism. The approach is based on previous advances in fMRI analysis methods that permit (a) the identification of a concept, such as the thought of a physical object, from its fMRI pattern, and (b) the ability to assess the semantic content of a concept from its fMRI pattern. These factor analysis and machine learning methods were applied to the fMRI activation patterns of 17 adults with high-functioning autism and matched controls, scanned while thinking about 16 social interactions. One prominent neural representation factor that emerged (manifested mainly in posterior midline regions) was related to   self  -representation, but this factor was present only for the control participants, and was near-absent in the autism group. Moreover, machine learning algorithms classified individuals as autistic or control with 97% accuracy from their fMRI neurocognitive markers. The findings suggest that psychiatric alterations of thought can begin to be biologically understood by assessing the form and content of the altered thought’s underlying brain activation patterns.

## Introduction 
  
Psychiatric disorders of thought are usually characterized and diagnosed on the basis of clinical assessment of an individual’s verbal and physical behavior. This is the conventional way to assess a thought disorder. However, recent advances in brain reading have made it possible to identify neurocognitive representations based on the underlying brain activation patterns assessed with fMRI  – . These innovations have advanced from merely associating an activation pattern with a particular thought to decomposing the activation pattern into its neural and psychological components. For example, the activation pattern corresponding to the thought of a banana consists of components representing how one holds a banana (indicated in several premotor areas) and how one eats a banana (represented in eating-related areas). Another example is that the thought of an emotion such as sadness can be identified in terms of the neural representation of its valence, degree of arousal, and sociality  . Thus it has become possible to assess the content of a thought in neurotypical populations. 

In our study, this approach was applied to characterize the   altered   neural representation of social concepts in autism, known to be disordered in terms of psychiatric diagnosis. If certain types of social concepts are altered in autism, it may be possible to (a) detect the alterations and possibly interpret them as diagnostic of autism; and (b) understand the biological and psychological nature of the alterations in terms of the underlying dimensions of neural representation; and (c) make use of the understanding to develop therapies that ameliorate the alteration. Furthermore, if the approach is successful with respect to autism, it may hold promise for application to other psychiatric disorders. 

One of the largest challenges in autism research is to determine the relation between the psychological alterations in autism (assessed in behavioral and psychiatric studies) and the neural alterations (assessed in neuroscience and particularly brain imaging studies). Because the social alterations are often the most prominent ones in autism, fMRI studies of autism have investigated the relation between brain and behavior with respect to several different types of social processing. One of the earliest-studied social functions investigated with fMRI was face perception, during which it was found that the fusiform face area (a brain region associated with the processing of faces) activated abnormally in autism  . A second type of social task in which altered activation was found in autism was in Theory of Mind processing in which participants must understand the mental state of another individual (and in which there is altered activation in autism in the medial frontal and temporoparietal junction regions)  . 

A third type of autism alteration involved in social processing (and arguably the most central one) concerns the altered conception of   self   (see Uddin   for a review). The altered conception of   self   in autism is at the focus of the current study. Since its first description by Kanner  , autism has always been prominently associated with a disruption of the social relation between   self   and others. In fact, the word   autism   stems from the Greek   autos   meaning   self.   Although   self   representation may have several types of components, such as visual self-recognition and perspective, the facet of   self   that seems most altered in autism is the relating of oneself socially to others. Individuals with autism exhibit atypical social behavior, manifested as disproportionate self-focus in social interaction with others. Hence the current study investigated a number of social (dyadic) interactions, using a neurosemantic paradigm in which participants are asked to think about a concept such as   to insult,   while their brain activation was assessed with fMRI. 

Several fMRI studies of autism that have involved   self  -related cognition have found disruption of the brain activation in midline cortical structures (ventromedial prefrontal, middle and posterior cingulate), as summarized in a recent review  . One example is that in participants with autism there is a failure to reduce the activity in midline structures during the performance of a cognitive task  , which has been attributed to a reduction of   self  -referential processing in the resting state in autism  . Another example of unusual   self  -related disruption in children with autism is the use of the pronoun   you   to refer to themselves, echoing the use of that pronoun by others to refer to the child, as first noted by Kanner  . This language behavior is ascribed to an errorful assessment of the relation between the   self   and another person. Consistent with Kanner’s observations, an fMRI study of pronoun processing in adult participants found diminished functional connectivity in autism between a frontal region (right anterior insula) and the precuneus (a posterior midline) region as well as altered activation levels in the precuneus  . Several other studies have found the precuneus to be involved in the representation of   self  ,  ,  ,  ,  . Taken together, these types of findings indicate disruption of   self  -related processing in autism associated with the precuneus and frontal regions. 

Findings of mean differences between autism and control groups in brain anatomy or brain activity have led more recently to classification studies in which participants are automatically (i.e. using an algorithmic statistical technique) classified as autistic or control based on such measures  ,  ,  ,  . Based on the structural grey matter anatomy measures, it was possible to classify the group membership with 85% accuracy  . With the voxel-based morphometry approach, the accuracy was 90%  . One study performed autism membership classification based on resting state connectivity data, producing an accuracy of 79% (and for the sub-group under 20 yrs, 91%)  , whereas another study obtained an accuracy of 96%  . There is apparently something distinctive about the brain structure and brain activation in autism. However, neither of these approaches relates a brain property to a specific type of concept or thought that is altered in autism. The current study examines whether such classification is possible based on the neural representations of interpersonal social interactions, which might be expected to be altered in autism. In effect, the study seeks specific neurocognitive disruptions directly related to thought alterations and not simply biological markers of the thought disorder. We asked whether it is possible to distinguish autism from control participants based on their neural activation patterns during their consideration of various social interactions, examining whether the   self   components of social representations are altered in autism. 

In addition to relating altered neural activation patterns to social concepts, the study attempted to determine what anatomical alterations in autism might be associated with the psychological alterations in the conception of   self  . One theory of autism relates the disorder’s behavioral and brain activation symptoms to altered frontal-posterior anatomical connectivity in the cortex, compromising the communication bandwidth between frontal and posterior areas  . The white matter tract that provides such connectivity between some of the main frontal and posterior midline regions involved in the representation of   self   is the cingulum bundle, whose structural properties can be measured noninvasively using magnetic resonance-based imaging of the diffusion of water molecules. An alteration in the representation of   self   could be due to the quality of this white matter tract. An a priori hypothesis was that the degree of alteration in the representation of   self   in individuals with autism would be related to the quality of their cingulum bundle. To examine this relation, diffusion images of this tract were obtained, in addition to the fMRI activation evoked by thoughts of various social interactions. 

Another hypothesis was that the degree of alteration in the representation of   self   in individuals with autism would be related to behavioral measures of various social abilities, such as face processing and Theory of Mind (c.f.  ). To test this hypothesis, appropriate neuropsychological measures were acquired for participants with autism. 

Autism is rightly considered to be a heterogeneous disorder, with suggestions made that it be referred to as “the autisms”  . There are anecdotal comments that every person with autism is autistic in their own way. Although autism is undoubtedly heterogeneous, a striking finding in brain reading studies of neurotypical people is the high degree of commonality (homogeneity) of neural representations of concepts across individuals. A classifier trained to identify the thoughts associated with physical objects like a banana from the neural activation patterns of a group of participants can then identify, with reasonable accuracy, the thoughts of a new participant whose data were not included in the training  . This activation commonality probably arises because of the commonalities in the structure, function, and experience of human brains as they process information related to physical objects. But how would a psychiatric or neurological disorder affect the commonality among the members of the affected population, particularly in a domain of thought that is altered in the disorder? Given the apparent heterogeneity of autism, should there thus be less commonality among people with autism than among people without autism when they are thinking about social concepts? That is, if autism entails altered conceptions of social interactions, are the alterations heterogeneous across people with autism or is there a commonality? New machine learning methods allow a comparison of the commonality within the autism and the control groups. 

The central issue remains whether it is possible to identify a participant as autistic, not just on the basis of a fortuitous statistical relation, but on the basis of some fundamental alteration of the brain activity that underpins particular types of thought that are among the defining characteristic of the disorder. 

Below we first apply factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the brain activation evoked by the various social interactions. Then we perform classification of the multivoxel patterns that correspond to particular social interactions in order to identify the interaction and to distinguish the neural patterns of the two groups. The advantages of the approach are that it 1. focuses on the representations of social interactions, which are likely to be altered in autism and which like other concepts, are neurally represented by multiple voxels in multiple regions, and 2. is capable of detecting group differences in the activation patterns of multiple voxels in multiple regions. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
The study acquired fMRI-measured brain activation patterns of 17 young adults diagnosed with high-functioning autism and 17 age and IQ-matched control participants as they thought about the referent of 8 social interaction verbs (  compliment, insult, adore, hate, hug, kick, encourage, humiliate  ), considered from two perspectives (either the agent of the action or the recipient), for a total of 16 social interaction items. There were 6 presentations of such 16-item blocks. 

### Ethics statement 
  
The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Boards. All participants gave their informed written consent. 


### Participants 
  
The participants’ demographic information is shown in  . The diagnosis of autism was established using the   Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule   (ADOS;  ), the   Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised   (ADI-R;  ) using DSM IV criteria and confirmed by expert clinical opinion. All participants were required to be in good medical health. Seven of the autism participants took medications on the day of the scan (six of these taking selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, three taking ADHD medications, two taking blood pressure medications, and three taking one of prostate enlargement, hypothyroidism, or allergy medication). Potential participants with autism were excluded if they had an identifiable cause for their autism such as fragile-X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or fetal cytomegalovirus infection or were found to have evidence of prematurity, birth asphyxia, head injury, or a seizure disorder. Exclusions were based on neurologic history and examination, physical examination, and chromosomal analysis or metabolic testing, if indicated. The control participants were community volunteers and were group-matched to the participants with autism on age, gender, race, and all three IQ scores, Verbal (VIQ), Performance (PIQ), and Full-scale (FSIQ) as determined by administration of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI;  ). Potential control participants were screened by questionnaire, telephone, face-to-face interview, and observation during initial testing and were excluded if they had a current or past history of prematurity, psychiatric and neurologic disorders, birth injury, developmental delay, school problems, acquired brain injury, learning disabilities, or medical disorders with implications for the central nervous system. Exclusionary criteria also included a history in first degree relatives of autism, developmental cognitive disorder, affective disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, or other neurologic or psychiatric disorder thought to have a genetic component  .   One of the control participants took allergy and asthma medication and another participant took an antibiotic on the day of the scan. 
   Age, IQ, handedness, and gender of the participants.        
Handedness was determined with the Lateral Dominance Examination from the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery  . Thirteen members of each group were right-handed; two of the autism and none of the control participants were female. 

Prior to in-scanner testing, each participant was familiarized with the task, and used an MRI simulator scanner to acclimate themselves with the scanner environment. The 34 included participants were tested in two epochs. In the first epoch, 9 participants with autism and 9 controls were scanned using a Siemens Allegra scanner, with 21 additional participants excluded from the analysis (as described below). Because the yield was low (18/39) in the first epoch largely due to excessive head motion, the pre-scanning training to reduce head motion was substantially enhanced in the second epoch. The yield for the second epoch (16/20) was greatly improved. In the second epoch, 8 autism and 8 control participants were scanned using a Siemens Verio scanner with 4 additional participants excluded (using the same criteria). 

The data from the 25 excluded participants (12 with autism and 13 controls) had been affected by either excessive (above 3.5 mm) head motion (6 with autism and 3 controls) or lack of attention to the stimulus in a substantial number of trials (6 with autism and 10 controls). Participants in such studies comment that occasionally their mind wanders when processing some items, and we have previously found such inattention to be characterized by an abnormal occipital activation time course. Consequently, participants in whom the abnormality (measured as a low correlation with a typical occipital activation time course) was frequent (occurring in more than 70% of the items) were excluded. (Calculations are shown in  ). 


### Image acquisition 
  
Functional images were acquired on a Siemens Allegra 3.0T or a Siemens Verio 3.0T MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using the same gradient echo EPI sequence with TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms and a 60° flip angle. Seventeen 5-mm thick oblique-axial slices were imaged with a gap of 1 mm between slices. The acquisition matrix was 64×64 with 3.125×3.125×5 mm voxels. High angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) were acquired using a diffusion-weighted, single-shot, spin-echo, EPI sequence (TR = 5300 ms) and processed using FSL tools and diffusion toolkit software  . (See   for details). 


### Stimuli and paradigm 
  
The stimulus set of eight verbs referring to interpersonal actions (  compliment, insult, adore, hate, hug, kick, encourage, humiliate  ) was presented one at a time, with instructions to think about the nature of the interaction from either the perspective of the agent (e.g., the participant insulting someone else) in a dyadic situation, or from the perspective of the recipient (e.g., being insulted by someone else), for a total of 16 different social interactions. Each block of 16 interactions (8 verbs × 2 perspectives) was presented 6 times. In each block, the two perspectives were presented separately and always in the same order for a given participant (and balanced across participants), while the 8 verbs within each perspective were presented in different random orders. There was a 10 s rest interval between blocks and also between perspectives within a block. The mean interval between the two consecutive presentations of the same verb was 66 s, and the maximum interval was 115 s. 

Each stimulus verb was presented on the screen for 3 s, followed by a 4 s rest period, during which the participants were instructed to fixate on an X displayed in the center of the screen. There were four additional presentations of a fixation condition X, 24 s each, distributed across the session to provide a baseline measure of activation. 

Participants were asked to think about the most salient properties of the interaction that the verbs described, for example, whether the action is intentional or not, the reaction it may evoke, and the context in which it occurs, to encourage consideration of multiple attributes of the dyadic social interaction. Participants were asked to think of the same attributes each time they saw a given verb. To encourage the consideration of a consistent set of attributes, prior to the scanning session participants were asked to write down the attributes of each verb in each mode/role. However, there was no attempt to induce consistency across participants. 


### Neuropsychological tests 
  
To assess the social processing abilities of the autism participants, the Benton Facial Recognition Test  , WMSIII Faces II  , and Reading the Mind in the Eyes   were administered. 


### fMRI processing 
  
The fMRI data were preprocessed with SPM2  . For each participant, functional images (about 15,000 voxels) linked to every instance of the 16 social interaction terms were computed and served as input data for the following analyses (see   for further details of fMRI data preprocessing). 


### Factor analyses 
  
To assess the neural representation of social interactions, a two-level, exploratory factor analysis (FA), as described in previous research  , was applied separately for each group. This dimension reduction approach aims to identify the relatively sparse set of cortical regions and voxels whose neural activity varies reliably across the set of stimulus items, while representing the relevant neural activity for each participant in a way that allows multiple participants’ data to be aligned and compared. The choice of parameter values in the procedure was determined by search and convergence in several previous studies. For example, the total number of voxels ultimately involved in the analysis, 135, is small, relative to the entire brain volume. However, our previous studies showed that increasing this number failed to substantially improve the classification accuracy and at some point the accuracy begins to decrease with additional voxels  . Several of the arbitrary-looking procedures below are the result of optimizations performed in several previous studies. 

The details of the factor analysis procedures (starting with the initial selection of 135 voxels per participant and ending with the uncovering of 4 major factors per group, together with the associated brain locations), are reported in the  . 

The FA procedure for a group of participants is illustrated in  . The 135 most stable voxels distributed across 5 brain areas were algorithmically selected for each participant. The first-level FA was performed separately for each participant, resulting in 7 first level factors (Fa-Fg,  ). (The number of first-level factors was fixed at 7, which was the modal number of factors for all participants based on the Kaiser criterion). These factors were characterized by their vector of scores for the 16 items and their associations with specific subsets of the initially selected 135 voxels. The goal of the first-level FA was to find the participant-specific distributed brain networks involved in the representation of social interactions. 
   Schematic diagram of the two-level exploratory factor analysis procedure.  
The first level factor analyses are performed separately for participants 1–13. In these analyses, the activation levels of 135 voxels (marked as red, green, and blue circles for the 3 participants) distributed throughout the brain are expressed via 7 factors (Fa-Fg), and some (but not all) of the voxels are linked to these factors. The second, group-level FA in turn expresses the 13×7 first-level factors in terms of 4 group factors (GF1–GF4). For each of these factors, the originating voxels are spatially clustered. A cluster of such voxels (characterized as a sphere) contains voxels that were initially selected from many (typically all) of the participants. The six largest spheres per factor were treated as the factor-associated brain locations. 
  
The second, group-level FA then attempted to find the components of these networks that were common across participants within each group. The group-level factors (GF1–GF4,  ) were also characterized by their vector of scores for the 16 items and their associations with specific subsets of the first-level factors, and, through these associations, to subsets of originally selected voxels. The spatially contiguous clusters of these voxels (factor-associated brain locations in  ) defined the brain locations of the neural representation components corresponding to the group factors. The number of factors in the group-level FA was limited to 4, beyond which they were not easily interpretable, and the locations were limited to the 6 largest clusters (characterized as spheres) per factor. 

The only outcome of the factor analysis that was used in the subsequent machine learning (described below) was the set of locations (centers and radii) of the factor-related spheres. The features (voxels) used in the classification came exclusively from these factor-based spheres (but were subject to additional criteria). 


### Machine learning analyses 
  
Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifiers with factor-based features were used to classify participants’ group membership and separately, to identify the 16 social interactions (see   for the details of machine learning computations). 

#### 1. Group membership classification 
  
This classification was performed separately for each participant, training the classifier on the remaining participants, and deriving the features from the locations of the semantic factors that emerged from the factor analyses. Specifically, the features were derived from the union of the 3 semantic factor locations from the autism group’s analysis with the 3 semantic factor locations from the control group’s analysis. Thirty-six spherical volumes were created (from 2 groups, 3 factors, 6 spheres per factor; each sphere was defined by voxels with the highest loadings for the factor). Each sphere was characterized by the activation levels of its representative voxels across the 16 social interactions derived from the participants’ responses. The 16 activation levels of the 5 most stable voxels in a sphere were averaged and then converted to z-scores. (The stability of a voxel was defined as the similarity (correlation) of its pattern of activation responses to the set of 16 interactions across the 6 presentation blocks.) The same procedure was applied to all participants, including the test participant, resulting in a set of features consisting of 576 values (36 spheres x 16 stimulus items) for each participant. Only 115 of these features were used, namely those with the largest absolute value difference between the group means in the training set (any number of features between 80 and 290 resulted in the same classification accuracy of 0.97). The machine learning procedure trained the classifier on these data from 33 of the participants (each labeled as autistic or control), and then it attempted to classify the remaining participant. In each of these 34 iterations of classification, the training and test data were kept completely separate, including 34 separate factor analyses. 


#### 2. Classification of individual social interactions 
  
The second type of classification attempted to identify to which of the 16 social interactions a given brain image corresponded. The latter classification was performed both within participants (re-iteratively dividing the participant’s data into training and test sets) and across participants in a group (training the classifier on data from 16 participants and identifying the social interactions in the data of the 17th, left-out participant). (see   for details). 




## Results 
  
### Overview of main findings 
    
The neural activation patterns associated with social interaction concepts such as   hug   and   adore   in individuals with high-functioning autism lack a subcomponent of neural activity in posterior cingulate/precuneus, which is strongly evident in control participants. This finding emanated from a factor analysis of the activation patterns of 135 automatically selected voxels (volume elements, each 59 mm ) from each participant distributed throughout their brain. For reasons discussed below, we interpret this subcomponent of neural activity as associated with   self  -related cognition. 
  
The individuals in the autism and control groups can be identified as such automatically with high specificity and sensitivity by a machine learning classification of the neural activity associated with these social concepts. This result was obtained when a machine-learning classifier based on the factor analyses and trained on the data of all but one left-out participant was able to correctly predict whether or not that participant had autism in 33 of 34 (97%) of the cases. 
  
An individual’s neural representation of a particular social interaction (out of the 16) can be reliably identified at far above chance level by a machine learning classifier that has been trained on the neural activity from the   same individual   in an independent set of trials, indicating a systematic relation between brain activity and the thought about a particular social interaction. 
  
An individual’s neural representation of a particular social interaction can similarly be reliably identified at far above chance level by a machine learning classifier that has been trained on the neural activity of   other members   of their own group, indicating a commonality of neural representations across individuals. This outcome attests to the similarity of the alteration across people with autism. 
  
The degree of alteration of the neural representation of   self   in an individual with autism is correlated with the quality of the brain connective anatomy (cingulum bundle) joining regions associated with the representation of   self   (frontal and posterior midline brain areas). The degree of alteration is also correlated with behavior (face processing ability as measured with the Benton Facial Recognition Test   and other tests), thus providing a multi-tiered account linking the neural activity, brain anatomy, and behavior associated with an individual autistic participant’s thoughts about a particular social interaction. 
  
This summary of results provides an overview but the details follow below. 


### Factor analysis results 
  
The main group difference was the presence of a factor in the control group’s activation with strong representation in the posterior cingulate/precuneus area, a factor that was absent in the participants with autism. We interpret this factor in the control group as being involved in   self  -related cognition, for two reasons. First, one of the main brain locations associated with this factor, the superior midline areas of posterior cingulate and precuneus, has been activated in many previous fMRI studies when a thinking task involved consideration of the   self  , and furthermore, several studies have reported that in autism this component of neural activation is disrupted  ,  . (The voxel locations most associated with the factor in this area are shown in  . The complete set of 6 cortical locations for this factor and the other factors are shown in Table S1 in  .). 
   Posterior midline   self   factor location.  
A. Location of the voxels (circled) derived from the factor analysis of the Control Group that defined the posterior cingulate/precuneus sphere of this group’s   self   factor. Voxels in this cluster (with MNI x-coordinates extending from 0 to −9) are shown projected on the mid-sagittal plane. (The coordinates and radii of all 6 spheres associated with this factor are shown in Table S1 in  ). B. Mean activation in midline brain structures for the verb   hug   (averaged over agent and recipient roles) for the two groups, differing in posterior cingulate/precuneus. The verb   hug   was chosen for illustration here because of the salience of hugging as a social interaction in autism, where enveloping pressure is sometimes desired but without physical contact between oneself with another person, as in Temple Grandin’s squeeze machine  . The depiction of the activation in this slice for all of the other verbs was very similar to   hug  , for both groups. 
  
The second facet of the results that is consistent with the interpretation of the   self  -related factor is the ordering of the 16 social interactions by their factor scores for this factor, particularly the items at the two extremes of the 16-item ordered list. The two items with the highest factor scores were   hate   in the agent role and   humiliate   in the recipient role (followed by   hate  /recipient and   insult   in both roles). The two lowest-ranking interactions were   kick   in the recipient role and   kick   in the agent role. By contrast, the autism group had no factor that ordered the interactions similarly nor which had a substantial posterior cingulate factor location, indicating a diminished degree of representation of the   self   in autism in the context of these social interactions. 

 shows the difference between the two groups for the verb   hug   in the agent role, indicating the relative absence of activation in posterior cingulate/precuneus in autism compared to the control group. Although it was previously known that there is sometimes abnormally low activation in autism in the posterior midline areas, the new results here indicate much more precisely how this region’s role is modulated by the degree of   self  -involvement in the control group, and hence what is altered in the autism group. 

Regardless of this factor’s precise interpretation, the coding of the social interactions by this factor and the others makes it possible to identify whether an individual participant belongs to the autism or control group, and furthermore to identify which social interaction he or she is thinking about at a given time, as described below. 

In the autism group’s activation, the comparably ranked factor appears to instead encode how physical the actions were. We base this interpretation on the main brain regions associated with the factor, particularly L precentral (a motor-related area) and L postcentral (a somatosensory area). The four interactions with the highest scores from this factor are   kick   in both roles,   hug   in recipient role, and   encourage   in the agent role, all of which entail a physical action). The four lowest-ranked interactions were   hate   and   insult   in both roles. 

The remaining three factors were similar between the two groups. We interpret these three factors as coding for the positive or negative valence of the social interaction, the accessibility/familiarity of the interaction, and the length of the verb name, factors which we describe in turn. 

The social valence factor assigned high factor scores to socially positive interactions (e.g.   adore, compliment  ) and low scores for negative interactions (e.g.   humiliate, hate  ). The valence factors of the two groups were very similar, assigning highly correlated (r = .96) factor scores to the 16 interactions. The brain locations for this factor included caudate and putamen for both groups. 

The factor interpreted as accessibility or familiarity produced factor scores for the 16 interactions that were highly correlated (r = .89) between the two groups. Furthermore, the brain locations associated with this factor, very similar for the two groups, included regions that are part of the default mode network, particularly middle cingulate, R angular gyrus, and R superior medial frontal. Our interpretation of this factor is based in part on the assumption that the more accessible the social interaction was, the more resources were left over to activate the default network. According to this interpretation, activation of the default mode network here is not an indication that these regions are semantically encoding familiarity, but that their pattern of activation is a byproduct of the ease or difficulty of semantic access. For example, for the control group, interactions with the highest accessibility/familiarity scores were   compliment   and   hug   whereas   insult   and   adore   had the lowest scores. 

The word length factor was extremely similar for the two groups both in terms of the brain locations (strongly associated with L and R Occipital pole for both groups) and factor scores for the 16 interactions (their correlation was r = .99) which were also highly correlated with the number of letters in the verb name (r = .98 for both groups), with   compliment   and   hug   anchoring the factor for both groups. The 4 factors together accounted for 41.8% of the variation for the autism group and 43.0% for the control group, with most of the factors accounting for similar amounts (9.3–10.6%), except for the word length factor which accounted for slightly more (13.3% for autism; 13.2% for controls). 

In summary, the factor analyses indicate a major group difference, namely that the autism group lacked a   self   factor and instead had a factor corresponding to the verbs’ impersonal semantic (abstract-physical) properties. 


### Classification of participants as autistic or control 
  
A machine learning classifier (GNB) that was based on the union of the two groups’ factor analyses (minus the participant being classified) was able to identify each participant as autistic or control with very high accuracy (33 of 34 or 97% of participants correctly classified), misclassifying one participant with autism as a control. The features of this classifier were derived from 3 factors from the autism group’s factor analysis (  physical-abstract  ,   social valence  , and   accessibility  ) and 3 factors from the control group (  self  ,   social valence,   and   accessibility  ), excluding the word length factor, which was very similar for the two groups. The pattern of brain activation levels for the 16 interactions in the set of 36 locations associated with the factors reliably distinguished the two groups. This outcome confirms the postulated differential neurocognitive representations of social interactions for the two groups, and indicates the substantial diagnostic potential of this approach. 

In summary, the differences in the ways that people with autism in this sample neurally represent interpersonal interactions can be used by a classifier to identify a person as having autism or not, with high accuracy. 


### Classification of social interactions 
  
It was possible to identify which of the 16 social interaction items a participant was thinking about, based on the neural representation of the 4 factors that emerged from each group’s factor analysis. A GNB classifier was trained on an independent subset (4 of the 6 presentation blocks) of each participant’s own data and then tested on their remaining subset (the mean of the other 2 presentations blocks). Each of the 16 items was characterized by its activation level in 24 spheres (6 spheres for each of the 4 factors) for that participant group. The resulting mean rank accuracies (hereafter, accuracies) for classifying the 16 items were reliably (  p  <.001) above chance level (0.56) for all participants (with mean accuracies of 0.71 for the autism group and 0.68 for the control group). The successful classification of individual social interactions indicates that the factor analysis captured important components of their neurosemantic representation. 

Another striking finding was the ability to identify which of the 16 social interactions a participant with autism was thinking about by training the classifier exclusively on the factor analysis-guided activation data of the other autistic participants (again using the same 4 factors from the autism group). This classification produced a mean rank accuracy of 0.82 in the autism group, with all 17 autism participants’ social interaction classification accuracies falling reliably (  p  <.001) above chance level (0.72). (The higher mean classification accuracies across participants than within participants may be due to the larger amount of training data in the former case). That the representation of a social interaction in a participant with autism could be decoded by training a classifier solely on data from other people with autism indicates substantial commonality of the neurosemantic alterations across people with autism. Despite the well-known heterogeneity of autism, the alteration of the neural representation of these social concepts is apparently similar across the autism participants. 

Similarly, there was commonality across the control participants, where the corresponding classification produced a mean accuracy of 0.77, with 16 of 17 control participants’ classification accuracies falling reliably (  p  <.001) above chance level. 


### Relation to anatomical connectivity and behavioral measures of social processing 
  
Diffusion imaging was used to determine whether the altered representation of   self   in autism is related to the quality of the cingulum bundle, the anatomical tract that connects the frontal and posterior regions involved in the representation of   self.   The measure of each autism participant’s cingulum tract quality was the mean density across all voxels in the tract (computed from MNI-space density maps representing the number of fibers passing through each voxel in the tract  . The measure of an autism participant’s rudimentary degree of representation of the   self   was the mean stability of their 3 most stable voxels in the main location (posterior cingulate/precuneus) of the control group’s   self   factor. The L cingulum tract density measure (corrected for participants’ age) was positively correlated (  r   = .50, p<0.05) with the rudimentary degree of representation of   self.   (The correlation for the R cingulum tract was lower and not reliable, but in the same direction,   r   = .17). This result indicates that better anatomical connectivity in a participant with autism between posterior and anterior midline areas (both of which have been involved in   self  -related activity in previous studies) was associated with stronger rudiments of a   self   factor. 

The strength of these   self   rudiments (corrected for participants’ age and full scale IQ) was also positively correlated with each of the behavioral measures of social processing: the Benton Facial Recognition Test score (  r   = 0.72,   p  <.05)  , as shown in  ; WMS III Faces II (r = .69,   p  <.05); and Reading the Mind in the Eyes (r = .78,   p  <.005). In addition, the correlation of the   self   rudiments with the ADOS social total was -.21 n.s. (the negative correlation is in the expected direction). The indicated p-values are Bonferroni-corrected for the 4 comparisons.

Both measures were adjusted for participants’ age and full scale IQ. One participant with autism did not have a Benton Test score. 
  

### Conventional general linear model (GLM) analyses 
  
GLM contrasts revealed none of the main findings of the multivariate approach. A between-group SPM contrast (Autism-Control) (all social interactions – fixation), explored with an uncorrected threshold of p = 0.001 and extent threshold of 5 voxels showed essentially no group differences (the autism group’s activation was higher in two small clusters (6 and 7 voxels) located in right superior and middle frontal gyri). The within-group contrasts (all social interactions-fixation) showed activation in similar areas for the two groups, including left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, superior frontal, left middle frontal and middle temporal, left inferior parietal areas, and bilateral occipital pole, as shown in  . The group with autism additionally activated right inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal and middle temporal areas.

## Discussion 
  
The main finding provides a plausible biological basis for the psychological phenomenon of altered conceptions of social interaction in autism. The factor analyses indicate the autism group lacked a   self   factor and instead had a factor corresponding to the verbs’ impersonal semantic (abstract-physical) properties. The participants with autism may have viewed the social interactions referred to by the verbs as though they themselves were a spectator (like an “anthropologist on Mars,” as described by Temple Grandin, referring to how a person with autism might view complex social interactions without self-involvement  ). This new approach to characterizing the nature of thought alterations provides a new meaning to the concept of   biomarker  , which is usually thought of as a biological marker of a biological state. Here we see a set of brain activation patterns constituting a biological marker of a set of   altered cognitive states   corresponding to conceptions of social interactions. The biological alteration in the brain activity corresponding to the alteration of the thought pattern can be considered a neurocognitive marker of autism. This overview provides a guide to the discussion section but the detail and substantiation follow below. 

The neurosemantic group difference is much weaker in non-social semantic domains. A small pilot study of 6 adults with autism and 6 controls examined whether the two groups differed to a similar extent in their neurosemantic representations of 10 tools and 10 dwellings  , two semantic domains that might be expected to be represented rather similarly in autism and in controls. Approximately similar machine learning methods produced substantially less accurate group membership classification, identifying group membership correctly for no more than 7 of the 12 participants (chance level accuracy would be 6 of 12), failing to find a statistically reliable group difference in the neural representation of concrete objects. 

Although the current findings with only 34 participants must be treated with caution, they help close the loop relating   brain activation patterns   and   brain anatomy   in autism to   thought   and   behavior  , suggesting a causal path. The evidence we have reported above shows that (a) the group differences in activation patterns in response to social interactions are sufficient for automated identification of autism; (b) the main distinction of the autism activation pattern was the near absence of systematic activation in a midline posterior cingulate/precuneus region associated with the representation of   self,   indicating a lack of psychological self-involvement in these social representation; (c) furthermore, in individuals with autism, the residual strength (stability) of the   self  -related activation rudiments in this brain area was correlated with the density of fibers connecting that area to a frontal region, which is also involved in   self  -related cognition; and the residual strength of the   self  -related activation rudiments was also correlated with behavioral measures of the autism participants’ social processing ability. The correlation with anatomy may be of particular interest because recent genomic research has uncovered several genetic alterations (copy number variants and single nucleotide variants) sometimes found in autism that are capable of altering axonal development and maintenance during early neurodevelopment, potentially leading to altered connectivity in the affected axonal tracts  ,  ,  . Thus, alterations in frontal-posterior brain connectivity may underlie the altered social behavior and brain activation observed in autism. 

One extension of this approach may be to the study of alterations in autism of thoughts of emotions. A recent brain-reading study has applied this method to identifying which of 18 emotions a neurotypical participant was experiencing, finding (a) high identifiability of emotions; (b) high commonality across participants; and (c) a set of 3 neural factors underlying the emotions (valence, intensity, sociality)  . These findings suggest that it should be possible to assess alterations in emotion representations in autism and other disorders using the current approach. 

### Study limitations 
  
Despite the very high sensitivity and specificity of the approach (33/34 or 97% of participants classified correctly), the study has clear limitations. First, the current paradigm, requiring significant cooperation during thoughts about social interactions, would be difficult to apply to participants with lower-functioning autism. Second, it is not yet known whether this type of classification can differentiate autism from other special populations, such as those with other developmental and neurological disorders. Furthermore, it would be desirable to develop a neurosemantic screening battery that contains a variety of items capable of evoking altered representations in a number of psychiatric disorders, along with a classifier that accurately identifies the disorder of individual participants. Each disorder could then be identified or diagnosed on the basis of its own characteristic alterations of thought. Because of the many co-morbidities among psychiatric disorders, one might expect classification of some individuals into more than one category. Fortunately, these limitations have the potential of being overcome through further research efforts. 


### Factor analysis implications 
  
There are several implications of the various factor analyses, most generally indicating that it is feasible to determine the underlying dimensions of neural representation of social concepts. Despite the fact that a concept evokes activation in many different locations, it is possible to apply dimension reduction techniques like factor analysis or principal components analysis to converge on a small set of factors or dimensions that can account for much of the systematicity of the activation. In the case of the 16 social interactions examined in the current study, the three dominant dimensions were the   self  -related factor for the control group or the physicality factor for the autism group, as well as the positive/negative valence of the interaction and the accessibility/familiarity of the interaction. These are proposed to be the underlying dimensions of the neural representations of social interactions. The names we have given each of the factors reflect our interpretations of them, which in turn are based on the each factor’s associated brain locations and its ordering of the 16 interactions. Because social interactions seem such an intrinsic concern of the human mind, it seems plausible that there exist a core set of dimensions for thinking about them. 

Regardless of the interpretability of the recovered underlying dimensions in a neural representation space, the mere presence of such factors, common over participants, suggests the possibility of there being a small number (say 50–200) of fundamental neural dimensions of representation that underlie all concepts. In effect, these dimensions would constitute a basis set, from which the representation of any concept could be constructed. It would remain to be seen whether any such basis set would be exclusively biologically given or whether there could also be experience-based dimensions that are part of the basis set. The idea of a basis set of this type is highly speculative, but as brain imaging research progresses it will become increasingly possible to assess. 

One of the assumptions of this study was that the thought alterations in autism are underpinned by a perturbation of some fundamental dimension of neural representation, which the results suggest may be the   self  -related dimension. More generally, it is possible that other psychiatric disorders may be characterized by a perturbation of a particular neural dimension of representation. For example, it is possible that paranoia may be characterized by a perturbation (overactivity) of a threat-detection dimension of representation. Perhaps psychiatric disorders that are currently characterized by verbal descriptions of altered behavior and thoughts may someday be characterized by altered neural dimensions of representation that can be localized to particular sets of brain regions that represent a particular property. 

The finding of a commonality of representation among the participants with autism reveals a facet of autism that stands in contrast to the well-known heterogeneity of the disorder. Although people with autism surely differ enormously among themselves, they must nevertheless have something in common. Almost everyone with autism has some alteration in social processing, but the form of the altered behavior can differ among people, for a variety of reasons, from people developing idiosyncratic coping strategies to people having different mixtures of gene alterations. But there has to be something at the core of the disorder that may be a defining characteristic. Many studies have characterized the behavior or the brain activation in autism as being altered, but often without specifying the nature of the alteration in terms that speak to its commonality across people with autism. The current results provide a possible core property, the neural representation of social interactions, that is altered similarly across participants with autism, namely in that the representation of   self   is largely absent. 

This finding supports theories of autism that postulated altered representation of   self   in autism  ,  . The correlation between the alteration of   self  -representation and the density of the cingulum bundle (which anatomically connects frontal and posterior regions involved in the representation of   self   is also consistent with the theory of frontal-posterior underconnectivity in autism  . 

The contribution of the machine learning is its demonstration that the factors and their locations are capable of accurately discriminating between participants with and without autism. The outcome of the factor analysis itself indicates that the dimensionality of the fMRI data can be reduced, but it does not provide evidence that the resulting dimensions are meaningful or useful. The machine learning provides this demonstration, showing that one of the emerging dimensions, namely   self  -representation, characterizes autism sufficiently well to enable accurate classification. Not for the first time, the multivariate machine learning analysis showed greater sensitivity to systematic activation differences than did univariate GLM contrasts. 

One potential application of the current approach is to provide a biological measure of altered social processing in autism that can augment conventional structured-interview measures, as well as neuroanatomical and brain activity biomarkers of autism. A second potential application is to provide a precise enough characterization of altered social representations in autism to allow the design of targeted therapies and neuropsychiatric diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, both applications of this approach may be feasible with other psychiatric disorders which entail a systematic alteration of particular concepts, such as delusions. But the most far-reaching scientific significance is that psychiatric alterations of thought can begin to be biologically understood in light of their direct psychological consequences using brain imaging techniques in combination with machine learning analyses.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>   ABSTRACT  
Social signals such as eye contact and motor actions are essential elements of social interactions. However, our knowledge about the interplay of gaze signals and the control of actions remains limited. In a group of 30 healthy participants, we investigated the effect of gaze (direct gaze   vs   averted) on behavioral and neural measures of action control as assessed by a spatial congruency task (spatially congruent   vs   incongruent button presses in response to gaze shifts). Behavioral results demonstrate that inter-individual differences in condition-specific incongruency costs were associated with autistic traits. While there was no interaction effect of gaze and action control on brain activation, in a context of incongruent responses to direct gaze shifts, a psychophysiological interaction analysis showed increased functional coupling between the right temporoparietal junction, a key region in gaze processing, and the inferior frontal gyri, which have been related to both social cognition and motor inhibition. Conversely, incongruency costs to averted gaze were reflected in increased connectivity with action control areas implicated in top-down attentional processes. Our findings indicate that direct gaze perception inter-individually modulates motor actions and enforces the functional integration of gaze-related social cognition and action control processes, thereby connecting functional elements of social interactions.

## Introduction 
  
The interdependency of gaze processing and motor actions plays a key role in our everyday social interactions. Underlining their joint functioning, empirical studies have revealed a strong overlap between brain areas that process hand and gaze movements (e.g.  ). Furthermore, it has been shown that social gaze impacts goal-directed movement precision ( ) as well as reaction speed ( ;  ). The latter, however, could not be observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ), who are also characterized by abnormalities in motor behaviors as well as the processing of eyes and observed movements ( ;  ). 

In social interactions, a specific role needs to be attributed to the perception of direct gaze, which reflexively attracts attention ( ;  ). Crucially, direct as compared to averted gaze has been described as a signal that conveys the intention to interact ( ). In line with this, empirical evidence suggests a facilitation effect of direct gaze on imitative behavior ( ;  ) as well as an attentional effect of gaze cues on manual responses to target stimuli ( ;  ). Yet, besides imitation and beyond attentional guidance of gaze, social interactions might require re-actions to gaze movements that are compatible but not identical with observed actions ( ). Still, how gaze interacts with action control processes on the behavioral and brain level and how the specific gaze context modulates functional connectivity between gaze and action control areas, particularly when tendencies towards spatial congruency need to be suppressed, remains unclear. Therefore, we systematically investigated how the perception of direct or averted gaze affects action control in the context of an fMRI-compatible and previously established spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SSRC) paradigm ( ;  ). Instead of using social and non-social stimuli as in previous studies, we realized a 2 × 2 factorial design by asking participants to generate button presses in a spatially congruent or incongruent manner (factor congruency: CON   vs   INCON) in response to gaze shifts produced by an anthropomorphic virtual character (VC), whose initial gaze position was either direct or averted (factor gaze: direct   vs   averted). As dependent variables, we measured task performance (accuracy) and reaction time (RT) as well as brain activity obtained via BOLD fMRI. 

In line with empirical evidence, incongruent compared to congruent reactions incur increased computational load and thus, lead to prolonged RTs and a decreased percentage of correct responses ( ;  ). Additionally, the incongruency effect should be reflected in an increased activation in a bilateral dorsal fronto-parietal network of frontal motor areas and superior parietal lobules, a network responsive to increased top-down attentional demands and need for increased action control ( ;  ). For the main effect of direct compared to averted gaze, we hypothesized brain regions sensitive to eye contact and gaze-related movements ( ;  ), namely the temporoparietal junction/posterior sulcus temporalis superior (TPJ/pSTS) and the fusiform gyrus, to show increased BOLD signal in response to direct gaze stimuli ( ;  ;  ). 

The main focus of this study was to investigate the interaction between the perception of gaze and mechanisms of action control. While some evidence suggests a general facilitation effect of direct gaze ( ,  ), in other studies, an association of direct gaze and accelerated reactions has only been found for compatible stimulus-response mappings ( ;  ;  ). On the brain level, both motor control areas such as the inferior frontal cortex as well as the gaze sensitive TPJ have been implicated in the interaction of gaze and motor control processes ( ;  ). Building on this, the present study tested whether the same brain regions are differentially recruited as representations of gaze-dependent incongruency costs. Furthermore, in light of evidence that indicates gaze-dependent functional connectivity changes of the TPJ/pSTS with an extended gaze perception network ( ) as well as multi-modal functional coupling of the right TPJ ( ), we expected gaze and action control networks to interact at the level of right TPJ connectivity, reflecting a differential integration of gaze-related and action control processes. Thus, in order to systematically investigate the relationship of gaze-specific incongruency costs in terms of functional connectivity, we conducted a psychophysiological interaction analysis and analyzed whether the interplay of the gaze context and action control demands modulates the functional connectivity between the right TPJ and an ‘action control network’, being composed of all action-associated brain regions as defined by a Neurosynth ( ) search including the search term ‘action’. In a context of direct gaze and an increased demand for action inhibition due to spatial incongruence, we expected to see increased functional coupling between our seed region, which was located in a functional cluster that has been related to social cognition ( ), and particularly the IFG, indicating an integration of gaze-related social cognition and action control ( ;  ;  ). 

In light of autism-related differences observed in the original version of our SSRC task ( ), we further obtained measures of autistic traits and hypothesized to replicate a positive relationship between autistic traits and gaze-specific incongruency costs. 


## Methods 
  
Thirty-two volunteers (15 females) participated in our study. Due to neurological and psychiatric conditions (sleeping disorder, ventricumegaly), two participants were excluded from all further analyses. The remaining 30 participants (14 females) had a mean age of 24 (s.d. = 5.08, range = 19–41), normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no history of neurological or psychiatric history and were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ). The mean group autism quotient (AQ) ( ) was 14.99 (s.d. = 6.38, range = [6, 32]). All participants gave informed written consent and received a fixed monetary compensation of 30€. At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed and thanked for their participation. The study protocol followed the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. 

### Experimental design and procedure 
  
The paradigm used in this fMRI study resembled an adapted version of previously used SSRC paradigm ( ;  ). Instead of asking participants to respond to the gaze movement of an anthropomorphic VC or the movement of a geometric symbol as in previous studies, VCs were always present. This allowed us to keep the social stimulus constant while now systematically manipulating exposures to direct compared to averted gaze. 
  
Experimental task. (  A  ) One of two female VCs demonstrating direct gaze in the congruent condition [indicated by the initial cue ‘GLEICH’ (German for ‘same’)]. The first gaze shift to the left requires a congruent left button press, the second gaze shift to the right a right button press. (  B  ) One of two male VCs demonstrating averted gaze in the incongruent condition [indicated by the initial cue ‘GEGEN’ (German for ‘opposite’)]. The first gaze shift to the left requires an incongruent right button press, the second gaze shift to the right a left button press. 
  
Before the experiment and before entering the fMRI scanner, participants received detailed instructions on the overall procedure and MRI safety. During the experiment, they were asked to respond as fast as possible to gaze shifts shown by the VC by pressing a right or left button using the right or left index finger, respectively. The experiment consisted of 24 blocks of 12 events each with 50% left- and 50% right-directional gaze shifts, realizing a 2 × 2 factorial design: congruent blocks were instructed by the initial cue ‘GLEICH’ (German for ‘same’) and required participants to respond to gaze shifts in a spatially compatible manner, i.e. pressing the ipsilateral button. The initial cue ‘GEGEN’ (German for ‘opposite’) introduced blocks of spatially incompatible responses, where participants had to press the contralateral button in response to a gaze shift, for instance the right button had to be pressed following a gaze shift to the left ( ). Each cue was presented once for 1500 ms at the beginning of each block of 12 gaze shifts and each block was followed by a jittered inter-stimulus interval of 15 to 17 s. During the experiment, participants did not receive any feedback on their performance. Besides the factor ‘congruency’, our second experimental factor ‘gaze’ was expressed by the VC either looking up (averted gaze) or facing the participant (direct gaze). Pixel coordinates and the timing of gaze shifts were identical over all conditions. In each block, male participants experienced one of two male VCs while female participants were confronted with one of two female VCs. The appearance of either of the two same sex VCs was equally likely. Stimuli were presented through the software package Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.; Version 18.1) on an fMRI compatible computer monitor (refresh rate = 59 Hz, resolution of 1024 × 768, viewable region of 500 mm × 380 mm) and were created manually in Poser 10 (Smith Micro Software, Inc., CA, USA). As stimuli of the present study differed from stimuli of previous studies, a pre-study was conducted to control for unbalanced stimuli preferences. Twelve volunteers (employees, 8 females) from the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry rated all four VCs on a five-level Likert scale on attractiveness, valence, arousal and other characteristics (Supplementary Table S1). A repeated measures ANOVA using stimulus type (VC 1–4) and characteristics (Supplementary Table S1) revealed no significant effect of stimulus type (  F  [1,11] = 0.94,   P   = 0.43) or interaction effect on VC ratings,   F  (1,11) = 1.15,   P   = 0.10. All volunteers correctly indicated whether the VC demonstrated direct or averted gaze and whether the gaze was directed to the left or right. 


### Behavioral and questionnaire data preprocessing 
  
RTs, the dependent variable that expressed the behavioral outcome of action control, reflected the time frame between the onset of the gaze shift and the button press of the participant. We applied the following RT data preprocessing steps (e.g.  ;  ): trials with no answer, multiple answers or incorrect answers were categorized as error trials. Further, trials with responses two standard deviations from the participant-specific mean RT over all conditions were interpreted as anticipation error or missed response and also labeled as error trials. In total, 9.4% of all trials were error trials. In order to exclude uninformative task blocks, e.g. blocks in which participants missed the initial instructive cue, blocks with more than 25% error trials (> = 3 error trials/block) were not considered in subsequent analyses, resulting in an average exclusion of one block per participant (Supplementary Table S2 for details). Task performance reflected the mean percentage of correctly answered trials of all correct and error trials, which was calculated for each combination of experimental conditions. The AQ of participants was assessed in order to evaluate the relationship of autistic traits and gaze-specific incongruency costs. To conserve comparability of AQ scores, missing values (four participants did not fill in one item each) were interpolated over the individual sub-scale values of the respective item filling in the missing data point. 


### Behavioral data analyses 
  
Main effects and interaction effects of experimental conditions on task performance and RTs were tested by means of repeated measures 2 (gaze: direct   vs   averted) × 2 (congruency: congruent   vs   incongruent) ANOVAs. To test whether direct gaze modulates responses in the congruent or incongruent condition, we implemented post-hoc contrasts of conditions (direct_CON   vs   averted_CON; direct_INCON   vs   averted_INCON) as Bonferroni corrected paired two-sided   t  -tests. After calculating the RT incongruency costs, i.e. RT slowing in incongruent compared to congruent trials, we obtained the difference in RT incongruency costs between the direct and averted gaze condition (incongruency costs direct—incongruency costs averted) as a measure of direction and size of effect of gaze on RT incongruency costs. To further analyze the relationship of the difference in RT incongruency costs between the direct and the averted gaze condition, we correlated the measure with AQ scores. Here, due to non-normally distributed AQ scores (Shapiro–Wilk statistic = 0.93,   P   < 0.05), the non-parametric two-sided Spearman’s rank correlation statistic was used. 



## fMRI data analysis 
  
Participants completed the experiment inside a 3T MR scanner (MR750, GE, Milwaukee, USA). The procedure comprised a single functional run of 290 volumes of 40 slices (32-channel head coil, AC-PC-orientation, 96 × 96 matrix, 3 × 3 mm voxel size, 3 mm slice thickness, 0.5 mm slice gap). First, structural T1-weighted images were acquired [BRAVO FSPGR pulse sequence, 1 mm isotropic voxels, repetition time (TR) of 6.2 ms, echo time (TE) of 2.3 ms]. Second, during the experiment, T2 -weighted functional images were obtained by means of gradient echo planar imaging (TR of 2000 ms, TE of 20 ms, 90° flip angle) and the first four functional volumes we removed to control for non-equilibrium effects. FMRI data preprocessing and analysis were performed in SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping Software, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London;   http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk  ) and included the following steps: functional images were spatially realigned to the mean functional image (rigid body transformation). Next, functional and structural images were co-registered. Both structural and functional images were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using tissue segmented T1-weighted anatomical images (BRAVO FSPGR pulse sequence, 1 mm isotropic voxels, TR of 6.2 ms, TE of 2.3 ms). Functional images were resliced to 2 × 2 × 2 mm voxel size. Finally, a 3D Gaussian Kernel with full width of half maximum of 8 mm was used for smoothing. 

All valid experimental blocks (RT data preprocessing) were modeled as epochs in a general linear model (GLM) with an average duration of 54 s (range 46–64 s). Experimental factors, i.e. ‘gaze’ (direct   vs   averted gaze) and ‘congruency’ (congruent   vs   incongruent) were captured in four different regressors of interest. Error blocks were modeled by a regressor of no interest. Our GLM design matrix further contained 26 confound regressors of no interest: the first 24 contained six z-standardized rigid body motion realignment parameters, their temporal derivatives and the squared values of both realignment parameters and derivatives ( ). Another two regressors captured confounding signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Here, we obtained a binarized mask from the respective segmented individual structural images using a 0.95 threshold in SPM’s image calculator (imcalc tool) and calculated the first principal component of the respective tissue type, explaining 85.42% (s.d. = 4.28%) and 79.11% (s.d. = 5.85%) of variance in the signal ( ). No global scaling was applied and low-frequency signal drifts were filtered out (128 s cutoff period). In order to correct for temporal autocorrelation of the data, voxel-wise maximum likelihood estimators were calculated ( ). 

Studying the effect of congruency and gaze as well as their interaction, BOLD signal during main effects and interactions of conditions were analyzed in a second-level flexible factorial design. A binarized group-specific explicit grey matter (GM) mask (sum of participant specific probability of GM > 0.05; imcalc tool) contained all voxels of interest. Besides our two experimental factors, we added a ‘subject’ factor, accounting for subject-specific heteroscedasticity, and implemented SPM’s default settings of unequal variances within each factor. In order to analyze the main effects of congruency and gaze, we contrasted congruent and incongruent as well as direct and averted gaze conditions [congruency: (direct_CON + averted_CON) > (direct_INCON + averted_INCON), (direct_INCON + averted_INCON) > (direct_CON + averted_CON); gaze: (direct_CON + direct_INCON) > (averted_CON + averted_INCON), (averted_CON + averted_INCON) > (direct_CON + direct_INCON)]. Statistical interactions of conditions were modeled as contrast of incongruency costs in the direct and averted gaze conditions [IA1: (direct_INCON > direct_CON) > (averted_INCON > averted_CON), IA2: (averted_INCON > averted_CON) >(direct_INCON > direct_CON)].

The light blue solid line represents the mean decrease in RTs from the direct to the averted gaze condition. Black horizontal lines represent the mean values, boxes represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), blue vertical lines the standard deviation (s.d.). 
  
Moreover, we conducted a generalized condition-specific psychophysiological interaction analysis ( ) to investigate the context-dependent functional coupling between gaze and action processing areas. Based on the available literature and a term-based meta-analysis in Neurosynth ( ), we identified a region typically labelled as right TPJ ( ) as the seed region for our gPPI analysis. The coordinates of our seed region [44, −52, 12] represented the peak coordinates in the brain map of the term ‘gaze’ (retrieved 2 October 2018 from   www.neurosynth.org  , z-score = 7.33) and were further situated in a functional sub-section of the right TPJ involved in social cognition ( ; Neurosynth, retrieved 3 June 2019, meta-analytic association of peak coordinates with terms ‘default network’, ‘mentalizing’). After creating a sphere of 6 mm radius in marsbar ( ; Supplementary Figure S1A), we extracted the first eigenvariate of our seed sphere and allowed actual ROIs to vary in size between participants, but restricted them to first level masks generated by SPM12. In order to investigate the context-dependent functional coupling of our right TPJ seed with brain areas involved in action control, we retrieved an associative ‘action’ mask from Neurosynth ( : retrieved 2 October 2018 from   www.neurosynth.org  ). After smoothing (3D Gaussian Kernel with full width of half maximum of 4 mm) and binarization (imcalc, i1 > 0.1, Supplementary Figure S1B), it was implemented as explicit mask in our second level analysis. Specifically, we were interested in the functional coupling of the right TPJ and the action network for the statistical interactions of our experimental conditions [IA1: (direct_INCON > direct_CON) > (averted_INCON > averted_CON)] and [IA2: (averted_INCON > averted_CON) > (direct_INCON > direct_CON)]. 

Statistical maps of the activation analysis are shown at a cluster-forming threshold of   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster threshold of   P   < 0.05 (FWE). In the psychophysiological interaction analysis,   P  -values were thresholded at   P   < 0.05 (FWE) at voxel level. The Anatomy Toolbox ( ; Version 2.2c) and the AAL atlas in MRIcron ( ) were used for functional localization and the Surf Ice software for brain visualizations (  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/  ). 


## Results 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
As expected, a repeated measures ANOVA focusing on the condition-specific performance revealed a significant main effect of congruency on the percentage of correct responses,   F  (29,1) = 32.09,   P   < 0.001, η  = 0.53. There was no main effect of gaze [  F  (29,1) = 1.80,   P   = 0.19, η  = 0.06] or an interaction effect of congruency and gaze on performance,   F  (29,1) = 1.27,   P   = 0.27, η  = 0.04 ( ). 

A second repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of congruency also on RTs,   F  (29,1) = 134.71,   P   < 0.001, η  = 0.82. Neither did gaze impact participants’ RTs [  F  (29,1) = 1.30,   P   = 0.26, η  = 0.04] nor did the interaction effect of experimental conditions reach significance,   F  (29,1) = 3.88,   P   = 0.06, η  = 0.12 ( ). Post-hoc contrasts showed that congruent RTs were significantly higher in the direct gaze compared to the averted gaze condition,   t  (29) = 2.86,   P   < 0.01, R  = 0.22. Incongruent RTs, however, did not differ between gaze conditions,   t  (29) = 0.17,   P   = 0.87.   presents the condition-specific performance and RTs.

Building on this, a two-sided Spearman’s rank correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between AQ scores and the difference in RT incongruency costs for direct as compared to averted gaze,   rs  (28) = −0.40,   P   < 0.05 ( ).

### fMRI results 
  
Applying a cluster-forming threshold of   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster threshold of   P   < 0.05 (FWE), incongruent contrasted to congruent trials [(direct_INCON + averted_INCON) > (direct_CON + averted_CON)] were associated with a differential increase in BOLD signal in the right inferior parietal lobule, left superior parietal lobule and right middle frontal gyrus ( ). For the reversed contrast [(direct_CON + averted_CON) > (direct_INCON + averted_INCON)], a large cluster of 2319 voxels emerged in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), including voxels in the superior medial gyri, superior frontal gyri and the anterior cingulate cortices, spreading to the right medial cingulate cortex. Congruent compared to incongruent trials further elicited activation in the right IFG as well as the left cerebellum and posterior part of the left fusiform gyrus ( ).

The cluster forming threshold was set to   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected), the cluster threshold to   P   < 0.05 (FWE) and cluster size (A) k > 414 voxels, (B) k > 287 voxels, (C) k > 638 voxels. [(A) SPL: superior parietal lobule, mFG: medial frontal gyrus; MFG: middle frontal gyrus (B) SFC: superior frontal cortex, FFG: fusiform gyrus, ACC: anterior cingulate cortex, MPFC: medial prefrontal cortex, CRBL: cerebellum; IFG: inferior frontal gyrus (C) lPS: intra-parietal sulcus]. 
  
During direct gaze   vs   averted gaze [(direct_CON + direct_INCON) > (averted_CON + averted_INCON)], increased signal was found in the right intraparietal sulcus ( ). The contrast of averted gaze   vs   direct gaze [(averted_CON + averted_INCON) > (direct_CON + direct_INCON)] did not show any suprathreshold activation. Similarly, significant clusters emerged in neither of the interactions of congruency and gaze [IA1: (direct_INCON > direct_CON) > (averted_INCON > averted_CON)] and [IA2: (averted_INCON > averted_CON) > (direct_INCON > direct_CON)] (Supplementary Table S3 for coordinates, T-values and cluster sizes). 

In our psychophysiological interaction analysis, we analyzed how the right TPJ was coupled with the action network for the interactions of the experimental factors, i.e. IA1 and IA2 (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S4 for coordinates, T-values and cluster sizes of all PPI contrasts). Statistical maps were thresholded at   P   < 0.05 (FWE) at voxel level. Results demonstrated that for IA1, which represented increased BOLD incongruency costs for direct compared to averted gaze, the right TPJ showed context-dependent connectivity with the IFG and the right middle temporal gyrus ( , brown color map). For IA2, reflecting increased BOLD incongruency costs for averted compared to direct gaze, activation in the seed region was coupled to activation in a dorsal network of superior and inferior parietal lobules, pre- and postcentral gyri, temporal gyri, occipital gyri, left superior, posterior medial, middle and IFG, right paracentral gyrus, left putamen and right cerebellum ( , blue/green color map).

## Discussion 
  
The present study investigated the effect of gaze perception on behavioral and neural correlates of action control of non-imitative re-actions. Our results demonstrate context-dependent functional integration of gaze and action control processes and our behavioral findings are in line with theories suggesting a relationship between gaze effects and autistic traits. 

As hypothesized, we found a significantly lower percentage of correct responses and longer RTs when participants had to respond in a spatially incompatible manner to the VCs’ gaze shifts ( ;  ;  ). Moreover, in line with a priori expectations, key regions of the so-called dorsal fronto-parietal attention network showed increased activation in incongruent as compared to congruent experimental blocks, possibly reflecting the increased need for top-down control ( ;  ). 

The opposite contrast, namely congruent   vs   incongruent, depicted increased brain activation in the left posterior fusiform gyrus and the MPFC. Given the lack of significant results in previous studies, we did not have specific hypotheses about the present contrast. A possible explanation for the brain activation found might be that similar to the sensitivity of the left fusiform gyrus towards faces and shapes ( ), MPFC activation has previously been found in response to spatially congruent gaze shifts, potentially representing occurrences of joint attention ( ). Hence, in a situation of low task difficulty, participants might have used free cognitive capacities to thoroughly process the social encounter with a VC ( ). Alternatively, representing a central hub of the default mode network, which is known as the task-negative network (e.g.  ), MPFC activation might indicate the occurrence of stimulus-independent thoughts that have been referred to as ‘day dreaming’ or mind wandering ( , Neurosynth, retrieved 3 June 2019: association of peak coordinates with terms ‘default mode’, ‘mentalizing’). Despite of the richness of literature on the decisive role of the IFG in response inhibition processes (e.g.  ), in the present contrast, the right IFG was activated during congruent blocks not requiring to withdraw from or cancel motor actions. Instead, the IFG might have come into play through holding representations of the CV’s gaze movements and hence, might have supported action understanding ( ;  ; Neurosynth, retrieved 3 June 2019: association of peak coordinates with terms ‘decision task, ‘comprehension’, ‘reappraisal’). Further, in light of its implication in gaze-grasping mappings ( ;  ), the IFG might have promoted a congruent button pressing by translating the gaze movement into a finger movement that corresponded to the direction of the gaze. Here, future research needs to clarify the specific role of the IFG during congruent task conditions. 

Direct compared to averted gaze was followed by increased brain activation in the right intraparietal sulcus, a region known to be involved in visuo-spatial aspects of action planning, the understanding of complex or irrational actions and the integration of visual and motor computations ( ;  ;  ). However, contrary to our hypotheses, direct gaze was not accompanied by increased activation in the right TPJ and fusiform gyrus—a result that might be caused by block design-induced habituation effects ( ). 

Incongruency costs describe the behavioral or neural cost of performing a spatially incompatible motor response. In the present study, we were interested in the differences in incongruency costs between the direct and averted gaze conditions. Contrary to our hypothesis, incongruent RTs did not differ between the direct and the averted gaze condition. As has been shown previously ( ), in a more difficult task situation, gaze did not have an impact on behavior. However, contrary to the reported facilitation of motor imitation with direct gaze, in our study, the translation of a gaze shift into a left- or right-handed button press was less time-consuming for averted gaze movements. Thus, our results indicate that the facilitation effect of direct gaze might not apply to non-imitative behaviors. Consistent with behavioral results, there was no interaction effect of experimental conditions at the brain level. 

The difference in RT incongruency costs between the direct and averted gaze condition represented a measure of the gaze-depended incongruency effect on reaction speed. A correlation analysis showed that high AQ values were associated with higher incongruency costs in the averted gaze condition, whereas the difference in incongruency costs between conditions diminished and even changed towards higher incongruency costs in the direct gaze condition with decreasing AQ scores. This result points towards inter-individual differences in the sensitivity towards social gaze, as a function of autistic traits. In this sense, individuals with low AQ scores might be more susceptible to the influence of direct gaze than individuals with higher AQ values. 

How the communication between the right TPJ and the action network changes depending upon the interplay of the experimental factors was addressed by means of a psychophysiological interaction analysis. Importantly, studies have indicated a functional partitioning of the right TPJ into an anterior and a posterior cluster: while the global functional integration of the anterior cluster suggests a mediating role in shifting from one functional brain state to another ( ), our ‘gaze’-associated seed region overlaps with the posterior TPJ cluster, implicated in social cognition, imagination and episodic memory retrieval ( ). As hypothesized, the context-dependent connectivity between our seed and the IFG, known to be involved in the integration of action inhibitory tendencies and motivational, emotional or social input (e.g.  ;  ; Neurosynth, retrieved 3 June 2019: association of peak coordinates with term ‘theory of mind’), was increased for incongruency costs in the context of direct gaze. As a consequence, the connection between the right TPJ and the IFG might reflect an upregulated exchange of gaze information and inhibitory control processes in the context of direct gaze. Moreover, in parallel to the association of our TPJ region to object or scenic imagination ( ), the IFG has been discussed not only to contribute to reactive but also proactive motor control ( ;  ). Accordingly, it would be possible that the IFG has been involved in preparing or anticipating a reorientation response that might have been supported by gaze-related input from the TPJ. In line with this post-hoc hypothesis, the right middle temporal gyrus has been indicated in mapping hypothetical motor actions to perceptual input ( ). 

Conversely, costs for reacting incongruently in the context of averted as compared to direct gaze movements were represented in increased functional connectivity between our seed region and major parts of the action network, predominantly in the left hemisphere and including the parietal lobules, the primary motor and sensory cortex, the frontal and temporal gyri. Besides belonging to the action network, the superior parietal and frontal regions are also relevant in top down attentional control processes ( ;  ) and have been shown activated in working memory tasks, during spatial attention towards or the planning of actions ( ). In summary, incongruency costs for averted gaze appear to manifest in more wide-spread connectivity that encompasses somatosensory motor areas. Incongruency costs for direct gaze, however, are reflected in increased connectivity with brain regions that are involved in both action control and social cognition. 

In conclusion, the results of the present study shed new light onto the neurobiology that underlies the specific role of direct gaze in social encounters: by increasing the connectivity of multimodal brain regions, the processing of direct gaze results in an integration of brains regions implicated in action control and social cognition. In this way, direct gaze could be seen as contributing to a comprehensive processing of the social situation that goes beyond a strongly stimulus-driven orientation.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical fMRI study in healthy adults (final N=23, mean age 26.4) that investigates social perception/animacy (perception and understanding of others). The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task-evoked contrasts (main effects of agent form, belief manipulation, and interactions) evaluated at voxel-wise thresholds and cluster correction; peaks and cluster locations are reported in tables and figures. The task is social-related (perception/understanding of others) and results are generalizable to a healthy adult sample.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study includes a healthy adult control group (H; n=18, ages within 17–65) and uses task-based fMRI during a social cognition task (Reading the Mind in the Eyes). The authors report voxelwise, whole-brain second-level analyses: single-group one-sample t tests were run separately for all five groups (including the healthy control group), and results are presented with cluster-level FWE correction and tables/figures of activation peaks.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social cognition (theory-of-mind) in healthy adults (Exp.1 N=17 analyzed, mean age ~28.5; Exp.2 N=20, mean age ~21.3), all within the 17–65 range. Participants performed social tasks (listening to narratives about others' beliefs/emotions and moral judgments). The paper reports whole-brain preprocessing and uses a Belief>Photo theory-of-mind localizer (reported in methods and supplement/figures) to define ROIs, indicating group-level/univariate task contrasts are available (SM/Fig. S1). Although the primary analyses are MVPA within ROIs, the study includes whole-brain task-evoked contrasts for the localizer and provides coordinates/figures in the supplement. No exclusion criteria apply (not ROI-only without whole-brain results; not resting-state/connectivity-only; healthy adult data reported).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Social interaction inherently involves the subjective evaluation of cues salient to social inclusion and exclusion. Testifying to the importance of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index   any   socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of   both   inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of exclusion require significant revision.

Humans are fundamentally social. We create and reside within a diversity of emergent social systems ranging from couples, families, and groups to cities, countries and civilizations. These social structures have evolved in tandem with biological and psychological mechanisms that support social behavior, and the consequent rich capacity for social interaction has enabled humans to survive, reproduce, and flourish. Central among these mechanisms is the ability to detect and respond to diverse signals of social inclusion and social exclusion – behavioral dynamics that are critical to the establishment and maintenance of relationships, groups and social hierarchies. Indeed, acceptance by our desired social partners is so fundamental that social exclusion has profound negative consequences for affect, health and well-being  and is particularly toxic during adolescence . 

There is burgeoning evidence to indicate that the mental ‘pain’ described by those experiencing such exclusion is more than just a metaphor. Brain imaging data suggest that the neural response to social rejection co-opts components of the well-established physical pain signature in the brain . Cues of rejection have reliably been shown to activate a network of so-called ‘social pain’ regions that overlaps with the neural response to nociceptive stimulation and primarily includes the dorsal anterior-cingulate-cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula (AI) . This account has been extended to suggest that the dACC in particular is involved in domain-general processing of pain information as it pertains to survival-relevant goal conflicts such as hunger or thirst and that social exclusion represents just one form of such survival threat . 

However, recent neuroimaging investigations within the social domain, have raised interesting questions about this social pain account of dACC-AI functioning . For example, multi-level kernel density meta-analyses  of the two prototypical social rejection paradigms used in neuroimaging studies – Cyberball (in which participants are excluded in a virtual ball-tossing game), and the reliving of memories of romantic rejection – have provided equivocal support for the claim that rejection activates the same neural matrix identified in studies of physical pain. Consistent with this, multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern analyses suggest that separate neural representations code physical pain and mental pain within this identified shared network . Parallel to this, some have argued the broad dACC-AI overlap between social pain and physical pain can be simply explained as salience, and hence trigger multimodal cognitive processes involved in detecting, orienting attention towards, and/or reacting to salient events . 

An alternative possibility is that this pattern of dACC-AI co-activation emergent from the social exclusion literature is not simply a form of ‘pain’, but instead a more sophisticated index of the social dynamic . One compelling candidate is that this network operates as a gauge of social inclusivity, a form of sociometer . If true, then this system would subserve the processing of any signal that provides salient information about social inclusivity, whether it indexes social pain or ‘social gain’. 

We therefore investigated the hypothesis that the dACC-AI matrix prototypically identified in studies of social rejection is in fact critically involved in processing signals of   both   social pain and social gain. We used a novel Social Feedback fMRI task that provides participants with comparably intense signals pertaining to either social exclusion or social inclusion, within the same paradigm, thus allowing us to identify their common and discrete neural substrates. 

Participants believed that they were competing with other contestants in a multi-round game. Participants were told that: at the end of each round, one contestant is excluded from the game while the others are included in the next round; each round involves each contestant individually performing a social task and performance is evaluated by a panel of judges; that these ratings form the basis of the inclusion/exclusion decisions; and that the game is played in a hyperscanning context  where each contestant is in a separate MRI scanner. In fact the judges and other contestants were confederates, only the participants were in a scanner, and only one round of the game, comprising our Social Feedback Task ( ; see also  ), was ever played. 

## Results 
  
Our results showed that participants rated negative social feedback as more upsetting than neutral feedback (  t   = 12.6, df = 55, p < 0.001) and positive feedback as less upsetting than neutral (  t   = 13.5, df = 55, p < 0.001), as expected ( ). Consistent with the social pain literature , the fMRI data (all whole brain,   p   < 0.05, FWE corrected) revealed greater activation in the bilateral dACC and left AI when receiving negative compared to neutral social feedback ( ). Critically, however, these same regions were also activated when receiving positive (relative to neutral) social feedback, along with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum bilaterally ( ). In fact, there were no regions that were significantly more activated for negative social feedback relative to positive (negative > positive contrast), even when we explored the data using lower activation thresholds (  p   < 0.005, uncorrected). Furthermore, the reverse contrast (positive > negative) simply revealed activations in the aforementioned ventral striatum and vmPFC regions, areas traditionally associated with reward processing ( )  ( ). These findings indicate that a common dACC-AI network subsumes the processing of information pertaining to both social exclusion and social inclusion. 

This was supported by a logical ‘AND’ conjunction analysis  of ‘negative > neutral social feedback ( )’ AND ‘positive > neutral social feedback ( )’, which revealed clusters in the left AI (peak voxel x = −28, y = 18, z = −10) and the dACC (peak voxel x = 2, y = 32, z = 24) that were significantly active across both conditions (whole brain   p   < 0.05, FWE corrected;  ). The conjunction contrast was masked inclusively using the contrasts ‘positive feedback > baseline’ and ‘negative feedback > baseline’ (see  ) to ensure activation was not a product of the neutral condition, though it should be noted the results were the same without masking the conjunction. Furthermore, separate psychophysiological interaction (PPI) functional connectivity analyses, seeded from these AI and dACC regions, showed comparable results for the positive and negative social feedback conditions (relative to neutral feedback) with significant (p < 0.05, FWE corrected) associations with activity in the right fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital lobe for both contrasts ( ,  , and  ). 

Is the common dACC-AI network identified here the same as that emerging from prior studies of social rejection ? An overlay of the results of our conjunction analysis ( ) on the clusters identified in the whole brain meta-analysis of social rejection studies  suggested that the conjunctive regions identified in the current data map closely onto the meta-analytic findings ( ), indicating that our Social Feedback Task is activating the same network as the Cyberball and romantic rejection paradigms reviewed therein. A similar overlay ( ), this time using just the results of our positive > neutral social feedback contrast, confirms that the network specifically underlying responses to positive evaluative information in the present data conjoins the social rejection network identified in the meta-analysis. In fact, if we extract the parameter estimates from our data that correspond to the peak dACC and AI coordinates from this whole-brain meta-analysis, they show the greatest activation during   positive  , rather than negative feedback in our data, suggesting that this network (hitherto associated with social pain) is actually more strongly activated in a social inclusion context. This is replicated when plotting the peak coordinates from a meta-analysis of social rejection tasks with a restricted focus on ACC activity  ( ,  ) and in structural and functional region of interest (ROI) analyses of the same regions ( ). 

Are there other potential accounts of the present data that merit consideration? One possibility (see   for a full discussion) is that the dACC-AI network activation found here in the context of signals of social inclusion simply occurs as a result of expectancy or carry-over effects from negative social feedback elsewhere in the task. However, these putative influences would also be present for the neutral feedback trials, for which the relevant activations were subtracted out in our critical positive social feedback contrast term, making this explanation less compelling. A related possibility is that positive and negative feedback activate a common neural network because they both involve some form of expectancy violation . However, again this seems unlikely because, if for illustration we focus on the critical positive feedback findings, the pattern of dACC-AI activation remains even for the subset of participants (  n   = 10) who (by their own ratings) expected to be consistently judged as best across all social domains and for whom the positive feedback was therefore unlikely to violate expectancies ( ). 

The shared dACC-AI activation also seems unlikely to be a simple function of emotional arousal as the effects remain after regressing out skin conductance responses (a reliable marker of psychophysiological arousal  recorded during the feedback epochs ( ). Similarly, applying an exclusive mask of the neural correlates of rating the affective impact of feedback (Rating Slide;  ) still revealed significant dACC-AI feedback conjunction clusters, suggesting that this shared activation is not simply attributable to affect processing ( ). Analogously, the pattern of dACC-AI activation in our feedback conjunction remained after applying either an exclusive meta-analysis mask of ‘salience’ (from neurosynth.org)  ( ), or a mask created by re-binning the feedback trials as a function of trial-by-trial stasis/change in social rank  ( ), suggesting that simple explanations based on general salience or social rank processing are also unlikely to account for the results. 


## Discussion 
  
The dACC and AI regions of the brain are implicated in a diverse range of psychological processes . Within social contexts, the dACC-AI network has hitherto been associated with experiences of social exclusion and rejection . However, our results show comparable patterns of involvement of this network in the processing of signals of social inclusion and of social acceptance. By comparable patterns, we mean we report significant independent contrasts of positive versus control conditions (either neutral or low-level baseline), and negative versus control conditions, and a significant conjunction (FWE corrected) for those separate effects. We are not intending to imply that those effects are identical in magnitude, although we failed to find any support for greater activation in this network in the face of negative social feedback relative to positive, or vice versa. These findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system targeted at processing signals of exclusion within social contexts, and the resultant mental pain, require significant revision and extension. The current data are more consistent with a framework in which the dACC-AI matrix indexes signals of social inclusivity more generally within social contexts - a neural sociometer . This accords with functional level models emphasizing the integration of signals of social inclusion and exclusion as a gauge of fluctuating social status , and mirrors a similar theoretical shift concerning the brain’s so-called physical pain networks which have also been shown to be heavily implicated in the processing of physical pleasure . 

Several notable strengths of the current study bolster confidence in these conclusions, including the relatively large (for fMRI) and population-derived sample (  n   = 56), the use of a novel task targeted at the key research question, the application of a comprehensive analytic approach to address common potential confounds in the social pain literature , and the stringent use of familywise error-corrected statistics. 

Other findings from the wider social neuroscience literature are also consistent with this view that the prototypical dACC-AI social pain network is involved in the processing of inclusive social signals. Somerville   et al  . , in a study ostensibly examining social feedback in the context of expectancy violations, report comparable levels of dACC activation when subjects viewed pictures of people who reportedly dislike them   or   like them . Similarly, rostral ACC activation increases in tandem with increasing expectation of positive social feedback . Furthermore, μ-opioid receptors (MOR) that moderate physical pain appear to respond to positive social feedback in key social pain structures . Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) combined with a social feedback task examining whether one is liked (social acceptance) or disliked (social rejection), MOR activation during social rejection was positively correlated with MOR activation during social acceptance in the anterior insula (left, r  = 0.79; right, r  = 0.62) and dACC (left, r  = 0.86; right, r  = 0.92) with no significant differences in levels of MOR activation in these structures between positive or negative social feedback conditions . 

Interestingly, potentially inconsistent data come from studies using the prototypical social rejection paradigm – Cyberball . Cyberball invariably contains a social ‘inclusion’ comparison condition where the participant is included in the virtual ball tossing game. Unlike social rejection, though, inclusion within Cyberball does not appear to activate the dACC-AI network . However, ‘inclusion’ here simply means not being excluded from the virtual ball tossing game. Such inclusion in this game playing context would be considered the social norm  and consequently is unlikely to be overt or salient enough to markedly activate any putative inclusivity-related brain network. To address this, some studies have adapted Cyberball by using an ‘over-inclusion’ condition in which participants receive the ball 80% of the time . However, if inclusion is the social norm as opposed to an overt, socially positive event, then increasing the number of social inclusion trials is likely to simply accentuate this. Indeed, although the fMRI results in these over-inclusion studies mirrored the usual Cyberball findings in showing that the dACC was more active during exclusion compared to over-inclusion, there was no behavioural difference in the level of subjective social pain reported between inclusion and over-inclusion conditions. This suggests that participants did not find over-inclusion any more socially rewarding than standard inclusion. Hence, while the Cyberball paradigm creates valid socially painful experiences through exclusion, it may be ill-suited to assess the social pleasure associated with inclusion. 

Some potential limitations merit comment. With the absence of a non-social comparison condition we were unable to evaluate the social specificity of our data, and hence rule out interpretations within the broader context of salience processing , although our findings remain even when exclusively masking brain regions prototypically associated with salience processing. Secondly, our GSR data suggest that the neutral condition was not equidistant from the negative and positive conditions in terms of elicited arousal, with the neutral condition being more similar to the negative condition. However, our findings remain the same when comparing positive and negative feedback to our low-level baseline (i.e., without the neutral condition) and when regressing out GSRs in the analyses, suggesting that this does not account for the results. Importantly, the neutral condition was well titrated in terms of its emotional impact relative to the positive and negative conditions ( ). Finally, as more resources and importance appear to be bestowed upon social evaluation in adolescence , our data may not be generalizable to the adult population. Future research into such questions would be beneficial. 

In summary, we show that the classic social pain network in the human brain, centered on the dACC and AI, shows similar patterns of sensitivity to signals of social inclusion as it does to social rejection. These findings have strong theoretical implications for our understanding of the role of this neural network in social cognition and are consistent with a neural sociometer that gauges the implications of all pertinent social information with respect to the organism’s social inclusion status. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were adolescents/young adults [  N   = 60; Mean (SD) age = 18 (0.7), range 17–20 years; 31 females] recruited from the population-representative ROOTS cohort (Total   N   = 1143) . We selected adolescents/young adults as we felt the Social Feedback Task would resonate strongly with that demographic. Inclusion criteria were: normal or corrected-to-normal vision; and English speaking. Exclusion criteria were: any history of neurological trauma resulting in loss of consciousness; current psychotropic medication use; current neurological disorder; current Axis 1 psychiatric disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; ref.  ); presence of metal in body; diagnosed specific learning disability; or IQ < 85 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; ref.  ). 

Participants recruited to the study showed no significant selection bias compared to the total ROOTS sample in terms of gender ratio or socioeconomic status as assessed using the ACORN (A Classification Of Residential Neighbourhoods) geodemographic measure  (  http://www.caci.co.uk  ). 

One participant was removed from further analysis due to a failure of imaging acquisition. Additionally, in the post-scan questioning (see below) three subjects reported some disbelief concerning the veracity of the cover story and were removed from all subsequent analyses, leaving a total of 56 participants for analysis (See   for participant data). 

The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by the Cambridgeshire Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent. 


### The Social Feedback Task 
  
The paradigm was styled as a ‘Big Brother’ game, where participants competed against other contestants (in fact these were confederates) to impress a set of six judges (also confederates) on a series of tasks in order to win through successive rounds of the game (they were told that one contestant per round was rejected from the game) and to eventually win the game. During the study participants were told they would be competing against three other contestants who were each located in MRI scanners located across the U.K, electronically linked so they can play the game interactively (hyperscanning) (see also  ). 

Participants were told that there would be three rounds of the game in total, with one person being rejected on each round until there was one winner remaining. In fact, this was a cover story and only one round of the game was played with all participants being voted off at the end of round one before being fully debriefed following a series of post-scan questions. For this first (and only) round of the game, each participant made a one-minute video recording to be rated by the panel of six judges. Participants were told that these ratings decided which contestant would be rejected from the game and who would progress to the subsequent (fictitious) rounds. The participants were told the six judges were together in a room at a separate location where they could be e-mailed the video recordings and from where they could submit their ratings. The participants were shown pictures of the six judges who were all just a few years older than the participants and were told that the judges had been extensively trained in making social judgments from video recordings. 

For the video recording, participants were asked to describe themselves, talk about what they enjoy doing, say what is important to them in life, outline their aims and achievements and say what was the most important thing that has happened to them was. Participants were given time before the video was recorded to think about these issues, and were shown a video made by a previous participant as an example. A still photograph of each participant was taken at this point for subsequent use in the fMRI session. Participants were informed that, for round one of the game, the judges would be rating these videos on a series of social dimensions (social competence, motivation, self-confidence, personal strength, social attractiveness and emotional sensitivity) that had been reliably linked to social success, prosperity and satisfaction across the life course, and that had been reliably shown to be easily rated on the basis of short video clips. They were told that, for each attribute, each judge would rank the participant and the other three contestants in terms of who was the best on that attribute (positive social feedback), who was the worst on that attribute (negative social feedback), and who was intermediate (neutral feedback) on that attribute. The decisions of each judge for each attribute (36 sets of feedback) were then shown to each participant during the fMRI session, prior to the final decision about who was rejected from the game on Round 1. Participants were told the design of the game was intended to build tension, akin to the voting on ‘Big Brother’ style game shows. 

To encourage believability in the other contestants, having made their own video recording, participants were asked to rate their competitors’ videos along the same social dimensions as the judges were using. Participants were told that each of the other contestants would be doing the same with their (the participant’s) video in the other contestants’ separate locations. 

Participants were told that different recordings for Rounds 2 and 3 would be completed following potential success on Round 1 (which never in fact happened, but was described in order to maintain believability). 

In the MRI scanner (See  ), each judgment epoch began with an 8-second ‘Judge Slide’ showing which judge would be judging which attribute (e.g.   David will now be judging you on social attractiveness  ). This was followed by an 8-second anticipation period of fixation, and an 8-second ‘Feedback Slide’, showing whether each contestant was judged to be the best (positive feedback), intermediate (neutral feedback) or worst (negative feedback) on that particular attribute by that particular judge. Following this ‘Feedback Slide’, and a 2-second fixation, a 10-second ‘Rating Slide’ of how the participants felt about the feedback (ranging from 0 (disappointed) – 10 (pleased)) was completed. This sequence was repeated 36 times for each social attribute from each judge, resulting in 12 ‘best’ judgments, 12 ‘neutral/intermediate’ judgments and 12 ‘worst’ judgments. Attribute and judge orders were counterbalanced across participants. At the end of the 36 judgments, overall judgments were made by each judge detailing whether the participant had made it through to the next round, a total of 6 such final judgments was made (one by each judge); 5 of which were ‘worst’ and one ‘middle’ resulting in the participant being rejected on round one of the game. Following the scan, as a manipulation check, participants were asked a series of questions aimed at assessing believability of the task and of the hyperscanning environment. 

All personally identifiable information (videos and photographs) was deleted immediately following debriefing. 


### Data Acquisition and Analysis Approaches 
  
#### Image acquisition and preprocessing 
  
MRI scanning was conducted at the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit on a 3-Tesla Tim Trio Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner (Siemens, Germany) by using a head coil gradient set. Whole-brain data were acquired with echoplanar T2*-weighted imaging (EPI), sensitive to BOLD signal contrast (48 sagittal slices, 3 mm thickness; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 78°; FOV 192 mm; voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm). To provide for equilibration effects the first 5 volumes were discarded. T1 weighted structural images were acquired at a resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm. 

SPM8 software (  www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/  ) was used for data analysis. The EPI images were sinc interpolated in time for correction of slice timing differences and realignment to the first scan by rigid body transformations to correct for head movements. Field maps were estimated from the phase difference between the images acquired at the short and long TE and unwrapped, employing the FieldMap toolbox. Field map and EPI imaging parameters were used to establish voxel displacements in the EPI image. Application of the inverse displacement to the EPI images served the correction of distortions. Utilising linear and non-linear transformations, and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) 8-mm, EPI and structural images were co-registered and normalised to the T1 standard template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Global changes were removed by proportional scaling and high-pass temporal filtering with a cut-off of 128 s was used to remove low-frequency drifts in signal. 


#### Statistical analysis approach to fMRI data 
  
After preprocessing, statistical analysis was performed using the general linear model. Analysis was carried out to establish each participant’s voxel-wise activation during the Feedback and Rating Slides (see  ). Activated voxels in each experimental context were identified using an epoch-related statistical model representing each of the three feedback trial types and subsequent affect ratings, convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function and mean-corrected. Six head-motion parameters defined by the realignment were added to the model as regressors of no interest. Multiple linear regression modelling was then applied to generate parameter estimates for each regressor at every voxel. At the first level, the following feedback contrasts were generated; ‘positive feedback’; ‘neutral feedback’; ‘negative feedback’; ‘positive feedback’ minus ‘neutral feedback’; ‘negative feedback’ minus ‘neutral feedback’; ‘positive feedback’ minus ‘negative feedback’ and ‘negative feedback’ minus ‘positive feedback’. The same contrasts were also generated for the ratings of affect (Rating Slides) following each Feedback Slide. For group statistics, random effects analysis was utilized. A conservative voxel-wise statistical threshold of P < 0.05 familywise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole-brain was used for all analyses.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Deficits in social cognition have been proposed as a marker of schizophrenia. Growing evidence suggests especially hyperfunctioning of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to neutral social stimuli reflecting the neural correlates of social-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. We characterized healthy participants according to schizotypy (  n   = 74) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism   rs1344706   in ZNF804A (  n   = 73), as they represent risk variants for schizophrenia from the perspectives of personality traits and genetics, respectively. A social-cognitive fMRI task was applied to investigate the association of right pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral face stimuli with schizotypy and   rs1344706  . Higher right pSTS activation in response to neutral facial expressions was found in individuals with increased positive (trend) and disorganization symptoms, as well as in carriers of the risk allele of   rs1344706  . In addition, a positive association between right–left pSTS connectivity and disorganization symptoms during neutral face processing was revealed. Although these findings warrant replication, we suggest that right pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral facial expressions presents an endophenotype of schizophrenia. We assume that right pSTS hyperfunctioning is a vulnerability to perceive neutral social stimuli as emotionally or intentionally salient, probably contributing to the emergence of symptoms of schizophrenia.

## Introduction 
  
Social-cognitive impairments have been proposed to present a marker of schizophrenia [ – ]. The impairments occur in different domains of social cognition, ranging from deficits in neutral face processing [ ,  ], emotion recognition [ ], up to complex social-cognitive processes [ ], like inferring others’ mental states, known as theory of mind (ToM) [ ], and are highly important for social functioning [ ]. The association of these deficits to enhanced activity and connectivity of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS [ ,  ]) makes aberrant pSTS functioning during social cognition a highly promising endophenotype candidate for schizophrenia. 

Several regions of the brain are central to social-cognitive processing, including amygdala, medial and inferior frontal cortex, insula, fusiform gyrus, as well as pSTS [ ,  ]. Most of these regions have been both found to be affected structurally [ ], as well as functionally [ ,  ] in schizophrenia. For investigating the neural correlates of social-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, we [ ] developed a social-cognitive task that assesses several aspects of social cognition (namely neutral face processing (NFP), emotion recognition (ER), and affective ToM (aToM)) using facial expressions as stimuli. Applying this task, we found activation in key regions of social-cognitive processing in healthy participants [ ]. In addition, hyperactivity in the right pSTS during NFP, but not during aToM, was revealed in two independent samples of patients with schizophrenia [ ,  ]. Furthermore, we found hypoconnectivity between the right and left pSTS for aToM, and a relative hyperconnectivity between the right and left pSTS for NFP [ ]. Other authors also [ ,  ] showed hyperconnectivity of the pSTS in emotionally and intentionally neutral conditions of social-cognitive paradigms. Since the pSTS is a core area of social cognition and prominently involved in inferring other’s intentions [ ] (also Schmidt et al., unpublished data), increased pSTS activation during NFP might be interpreted as a vulnerability for false-positive perceptions of intentions, also called hypermentalizing [ ]. 

Imaging genetics studies with healthy participants and with relatives of patients with schizophrenia provided further evidence for aberrant pSTS functioning during social cognition as an endophenotype of schizophrenia. ZNF804A, a zinc-finger protein, presents an odds ratio of 1.08 (0.92–1.26 95% CI) for schizophrenia samples [ ]. One of its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs,   rs1344706  ) [ ,  ] was identified in whole-genome association studies as the first common genetic variant associated with schizophrenia [ ,  ].   Rs1344706   is involved in regulating gene expression [ ], and has been linked to executive functioning [ ] and social cognition [ ]. Imaging genetics findings from two healthy samples suggest that activity and connectivity of the STS and adjacent temporoparietal junction are associated with variation in   rs1344706   in a mentalizing task with sketches [ ,  ]. Further, healthy relatives of patients with schizophrenia showed aberrant activation in this task. Family members had reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex during mentalizing, but increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. Interestingly, activation in right middle temporal gyrus during mentalizing correlated positively with self-reported paranoid ideation [ ]. These findings are exemplary of the approach to identify endophenotypes by investigating variations of traits of a disease in healthy participants. 

Schizotypy as part of the schizophrenia spectrum is a valuable construct that refers to personality structures spreading dimensionally throughout the population [ ,  ], but can also present as a personality disorder [ ]. Schizotypy can be characterized by a three-factor model of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms, including positive (e.g., ideas of reference), negative (e.g., no close friends), and disorganization symptoms (e.g., eccentric behavior). Several studies have consistently revealed an association between schizotypy and the development of a psychotic disorder (for a review please see ref. [ ]). A longitudinal study reported that 9% of an at-risk sample had a transition to schizophrenia within 12 months, and suggested self-reported schizotypy presenting the most reliable scale-based predictor [ ]. In addition, accumulating evidence points to schizotypy and schizophrenia having common genetic [ ], neuroanatomical [ ], and neurocognitive [ ] abnormalities, which again highlights the strong associations between schizotypy and schizophrenia. Importantly, as in schizophrenia, schizotypy has been associated with different kinds of social-cognitive deficits [ ,  ]. 

To date, only two fMRI studies have investigated the association between neural correlates of mentalizing and schizotypy in healthy participants. Both studies found right pSTS activity for mentalizing varying with schizotypy [ ,  ]. However, whereas one [ ] revealed negative symptoms to be positively related to right pSTS activation during mentalizing, the other [ ] showed a positive association with positive symptoms. In these studies, different tasks and accordingly different stimulus materials were used to investigate ToM, possibly explaining the divergent results. An even more general and crucial aspect when comparing social-cognitive studies, however, is not only the selection of stimulus material but also of the control condition (ranging from emotionally neutral analogs of the experimental condition to completely nonsocial conditions), which is usually subtracted from the higher-order social-cognitive process. Therefore, divergent findings in prior studies might be explained by differences in brain activation in the control condition between participants with and without schizophrenia risk. 

To summarize, deficits in social cognition are proposed to present a marker for schizophrenia [ ], and aberrant pSTS functioning during social cognition is a promising endophenotype of schizophrenia [ ,  ]. In this imaging genetics study, we applied a social-cognitive fMRI task [ ,  ] that assesses different social-cognitive processes, and has consistently revealed right pSTS hyperactivation during NFP, but not during mentalizing, in patients with schizophrenia [ ,  ]. We aimed at investigating whether we find in healthy participants a comparable activation and connectivity pattern as in schizophrenia, depending on the   ZNF804A rs1344706   risk allele, and schizotypy. This allowed us to assess possible pSTS hyperfunctioning unconfounded of medication status, or chronicity of disease. For both   ZNF804A rs1344706   risk allele and schizotypy, previous studies found a relationship to aberrant pSTS activation during mentalizing [ ,  ,  ,  ], but the response to neutral facial expressions was not investigated. We hypothesized that activation and connectivity of the right pSTS in response to neutral facial expressions in healthy participants is positively associated with (1) the risk allele of the   rs1344706   genotype and (2) higher self-reported schizotypy. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Of 81 healthy participants, seven were excluded for the present analyses: five due to low fMRI data quality, one due to a BDI-II [ ] score >18, and one due to schizotypy scores >3 SD above the group mean. For the genetics analyses, one additional participant was excluded because genotyping for rs1344706 was not possible. Therefore, we included 74 participants (40 females, see Table  ) in the behavioral and imaging analyses and 73 participants (39 females) for the imaging genetic analyses. Participants were grouped for the imaging genetics analysis for the existence of the risk allele of schizophrenia [ ]; ZNF804A genotype groups: 62 AA/CA (risk-allele carriers and 11 CC non-risk-allele carriers). All participants were of German ancestry, had higher school certificate, were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no self-reported background of mental or neurological disorders, or drug abuse. In addition, participants reported having no relatives with psychotic disorders.

The data reported here are part of a larger study on the human mirror neuron system that involved a measurement containing simultaneous EEG-fMRI with three tasks (including an imitation task, an empathy task, and the social-cognitive task presented here), blood-taking and a series of questionnaires, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ [ ], details are presented in the Supplementary Text  ), and a second measurement with transcranial magnetic stimulation prior to fMRI. The results reported in this paper are based on the fMRI data of the first appointment. 


### Experimental paradigm 
  
We applied a modified version of the social-cognitive task that was used in earlier studies with patients with schizophrenia [ ,  ]. The paradigm was extended to four conditions, including three levels of social cognition [lower-level social cognition (NFP), ER, and higher-level social cognition (aToM)], and a nonsocial control condition. In each trial of the social-cognitive conditions, a statement preceded a facial expression. These statements described the facial expressions referring to physical features (gender or age) for NFP, the emotional state (fear or anger) for ER, or the possible intention (running away or blustering) for aToM. For NFP, only neutral facial stimuli were shown, for ER and aToM only emotional facial expressions. The facial stimuli were taken from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces set [ ]. Half of the stimulus persons were male, and the same persons were used for each of the social-cognitive conditions. For the control condition, prior to a geometric figure (a triangle or a circle) a statement describing the figure (e.g., “This is a circle”) was displayed. Task duration was around 8 min (details of timing and presentation can be found in Fig.   and Supplementary Text  ).

### Genotyping 
  
Genotypes for   ZNF804A SNP rs1344706   were extracted from whole-genome genotype data obtained using Illumina Global Screening array and following stringent quality control (see Supplementary Text  ). 


### Imaging data acquisition and analyses 
  
The study was conducted with a 3-Tesla Siemens Tim TRIO whole-body magnetic resonance tomography (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany; acquisition protocol can be found in Supplementary Text  ). Brain activity and connectivity analyses were conducted with SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). Data preprocessing contained slice-time correction, realignment, co-registration to the structural image, spatial normalization (MNI template) with resampling to a 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxel size, and spatially smoothing with an 8 mm full-width half-maximum kernel. The first-level analyses were achieved by a general linear model with four regressors (aToM, ER, NFP, and control), and six motion parameters, derived from the realignment procedure, as covariates. The hemodynamic response function was modeled to the onset times of the pictures. The time series was high-pass filtered using a 128 Hz function. From the model, linear combinations of the regressors built the contrasts of interest, including effects of each higher against the lower social-cognitive condition (aToM > ER, ER > NFP), and each condition against control (aToM >control, ER > control, NFP > control). Connectivity analyses were applied using generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI [ ]), as implemented in the gPPI toolbox (  http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi  ) with a functional mask of right STS as seed region, produced from our previous comparison between aToM and ER in 40 undergraduate students [ ] (details of the gPPI analysis are reported in Supplementary Text  ). 

For second-level analyses, significance threshold for exploratory whole-brain analyses was   p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected,   k   = 10. We conducted one sample   t   tests to analyze the effect of each social-cognitive condition, and a within-subject one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify the neural correlates of increased social-cognitive processing (contrast: [aToM > control] > [ER > control] > [NFP > control]). Regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between the factors related to schizophrenia (schizotypy and the rs1344706 risk allele) and right pSTS activation, and connectivity for the different social-cognitive conditions. Region of interests were right and left pSTS, as derived from an earlier study [ ]. These masks were also applied in our studies on patients with schizophrenia [ ,  ]. The significance threshold for the ROI analyses was set to   p   < 0.05 small volume corrected (svc),   k   = 10. Behavioral data were analyzed with SPSS version 23. Differences between the social-cognitive conditions in reaction times (RTs) or accuracy were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA, post hoc tests were conducted with paired-samples   t   tests. Pearson correlation was applied to investigate possible associations among task conditions, and to test the associations between schizotypy and task performance. We conducted independent sample   t   tests to test genotype effects on task performance, as well as to investigate differences in self-reported schizotypy, depending on genotype. 



## Results 
  
### Behavior 
  
Similar to our previous studies [ ,  ,  ], RTs and accuracy differed significantly between conditions, with the control condition being the easiest and aToM being the most difficult task condition. Neither genotype nor schizotypy significantly affected task performance (detailed behavioral results are reported in Supplementary Text   and Supplementary Fig.  ). In addition, no significant differences in self-reported schizotypy were revealed, depending on the risk allele (see Table  ). 


### Imaging 
  
Replicating the results from our previous studies [ ,  ], activation increased linearly from NFP over ER to aToM in regions of the “social brain”, including bilateral superior temporal gyrus covering pSTS, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus covering BA44 (Fig.  ; detailed results of task effects are presented in Supplementary Table  ). Whole-brain analyses of right pSTS connectivity differences between conditions were not significant across participants. ROI analyses revealed greater pSTS connectivity between hemispheres for aToM compared with ER at the trend level (peak voxel: −57, −49, 7;   t   = 3.37,   p   = 0.069 svc,   k   = 10).    Neural correlates of distinct social-cognitive processes.  
 a)   neural correlates of increasing social-cognitive demands [with the contrast: (affective theory of mind > control) > (emotion recognition > control) > (neutral face processing > control)];   b)   affective theory of mind (> emotion recognition);   c)   emotion recognition (> neutral face processing);   d)   neutral face processing (> control condition). Significance threshold is   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected,   k   = 10. 
  

#### rs1344706 
  
ROI analyses revealed that risk-allele carriers compared with non-risk-allele carriers had increased right pSTS activation during NFP (> control; peak voxel: 63, −58, 13;   t   = 3.19,   p   = 0.042 svc,   k   = 10, Fig.  ). No significant differences in pSTS activation were found for ER and aToM, and also right–left pSTS connectivity during all task conditions did not differ between risk-allele carriers and non-risk-allele carriers. In addition, whole-brain analyses with the given significance threshold revealed no significant group differences, neither in the activation nor in the connectivity analyses.    Associations between functioning of right posterior superior temporal sulcus for neutral face processing and schizotypy as well as rs1344706 genotype.  
The first two scatter plots show positive correlations between activation in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) for neutral face processing (> control) and   a)   disorganization, as well as   b)   positive symptoms;   c)   positive association of disorganization with right-to-left pSTS connectivity for neutral face processing (> control);   d)   genotype effect of increased activation in the right pSTS for neutral face processing (> control). Significance threshold for display purposes is   p   < 0.005 uncorrected,   k   = 10. Note: rpSTS stands for right posterior superior temporal sulcus, lpSTS stands for left posterior superior temporal sulcus. 
  


#### Schizotypy 
  
There was a trend for a positive association between right pSTS activation for NFP (> control) and schizotypy sum score (peak voxel: 63, −55, 10;   t   = 3.01,   p   = 0.065 svc,   k   = 10). There was also a significant positive association between activation in right pSTS and disorganization symptoms (peak voxel: 57, −55, 7;   t   = 3.54,   p   = 0.018 svc,   k   = 10, Fig.  ), and at the trend level with positive symptoms (peak voxel: 63, −55, 10;   t   = 3.94,   p   = 0.077 svc,   k   = 10, Fig.  ). ROI analysis also revealed a significant positive correlation between disorganization symptoms and right–left pSTS connectivity during NFP (> control; peak voxel: −45, −70, 22;   t   = 3.60,   p   = 0.038 svc,   k   = 10, see Fig.  ). Neither for ER nor for aToM were significant associations between schizotypy and pSTS activation, or connectivity found. In addition, whole-brain analyses with the given significance threshold did not reveal any significant associations of schizotypy with task-related brain activation and connectivity. 




## Discussion 
  
This study aimed at investigating whether pSTS functioning during social-cognitive processing is an endophenotype for schizophrenia. Confirming our hypothesis, we found a positive association of right pSTS activation for neutral face processing with schizotypy (in particular disorganization, and positive symptoms on a trend level), and also with a risk allele for schizophrenia. Furthermore, connectivity between the right and left pSTS during neutral face processing was positively associated with disorganization symptoms. 

The pSTS is consistently found to be involved in inferring goals and intentions [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Across participants, we replicated our previous findings showing decreased performance and increased activation in pSTS and BA44 with increasing social-cognitive demands. With this, our results again highlighted the role of pSTS functioning for inferring others’ intentions [ ]. Importantly, increased right pSTS functioning in our participants with schizophrenia risk allele and subclinical symptoms of schizophrenia was present only for neutral face processing, but not for higher-order social-cognitive conditions. This supports our previous findings and conclusions that impairments in higher-order social cognition in schizophrenia might originate in impaired basic social-cognitive processes [ ,  ]. Our results are also consistent with further previous findings with patients with schizophrenia. A recent study reported not only increased pSTS activation in response to the emotionally and intentionally neutral control condition in their social-cognitive task but also increased pSTS connectivity [ ]. These results add to the idea that pSTS dysfunction for neutral social stimuli might be regarded as neural basis for hypermentalizing, which may constitute a vulnerability to the emergence of delusion [ ]. 

But how could this pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral facial expressions cause symptoms of schizophrenia? Kapur [ ,  ] proposed that psychosis, particularly delusions, result from aberrant attribution of novelty and salience to objects and associations, and that faulty attributions of salience arise due to chaotic, context-inappropriate firing of dopamine neurons. Delusions have been suggested to represent a deficit in encoding the precision of predictions and prediction errors [ ], indicating a bottom-up inappropriate perceptual input; i.e., aberrant salience. Supporting this idea, our results revealed a positive association between self-reported symptoms of schizotypy, as well as between the presence of a risk allele for schizophrenia, and activation in the right pSTS for neutral faces, and unveiled a positive association between disorganization and right-to-left pSTS connectivity. This might indicate that people with higher positive symptoms and a genetic risk for schizophrenia might be prone to perceive neutral faces as emotionally or intentionally salient. Whether these inappropriate perceptual inputs lead to delusions in turn could depend on how individuals interpret these false perceptions, pointing to the importance of a top-down cognitive explanation to delusions [ ,  ], and the impact of disorganization. When the cognitive explanation is interfered or interrupted due to executive dysfunction, the accumulating experiences of aberrant salience might gradually increase confusion and result in delusional ideas that are based on overinterpretation of emotions and intentions to neutral social stimuli. 

Together, our findings add to the perspective that delusions probably derive from dynamic interactions between bottom-up erroneous perception and top-down cognitive deficits, caused by increased responsiveness to emotionally and intentionally neutral social stimuli [ ]. Since all of our participants were without a history of mental disorders, we found alterations only on the level of neural functioning. Further studies with large patient samples that allow the analysis of subgroups are needed to investigate the validity of the proposed mechanisms in schizophrenia. 

Importantly, aberrantly high pSTS functioning in response to neutral social stimuli seems to be not “only” a marker of schizophrenia, but an endophenotype of schizophrenia according to the criteria characterizing an endophenotype proposed by Gottesman and Gould [ ]: (1) the endophenotype is associated with illness in the population: aberrant right pSTS functioning is consistently observed in patients with schizophrenia in response to stimuli and situations without emotional, or intentional meaning [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Our current results show a comparable neural pattern in healthy participants with increased proneness to schizophrenia, illustrating an association of right pSTS dysfunction with schizophrenia symptoms also in healthy participants. (2) The endophenotype is heritable: in line with previous studies showing aberrant pSTS functioning in schizophrenia risk-allele carriers [ ,  ], we found increased right pSTS activity in response to the neutral condition in   rs1344706   risk-allele carriers, possibly reflecting one aspect of the heredity of the right pSTS dysfunction. (3) The endophenotype should be state-independent: we found the neural pattern first in schizophrenia out-patients who were remitted from positive pathology [ ], then in in-patients with schizophrenia [ ], now even in healthy participants carrying the psychosis allele, suggesting that right pSTS dysfunction might represent a state-independent neural pattern for schizophrenia. (4) Within families, endophenotype and illness co-segregate: increased engagement of right pSTS varied with positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia’ relatives [ ], suggesting that right pSTS dysfunction and schizophrenia symptoms co-segregate within families. However, studies systematically investigating differences in pSTS functioning between relatives of patients with schizophrenia are pending. (5) The endophenotype in affected family members is found at a higher rate in non-affected family members than in healthy participants: While hyperfunctioning was observed in relatives of patients with schizophrenia who reported positive symptoms, it is also found in non-affected family members at a higher rate than in healthy participants without familial risk for schizophrenia [ ]. In addition to the criteria initially proposed by Gottesman and Gould, a further criterion has been put forward [ ]: (6) the endophenotype should be a trait that can be measured reliably, and ideally is more strongly related with the disease of interest than with other psychiatric conditions: aberrant activation in the right pSTS was consistently revealed by our social-cognitive task in patients with schizophrenia [ ,  ] and also in the current study in healthy participants with increased schizophrenic proneness, but not in patients with borderline personality disorder [ ]. In addition, especially in patients with schizophrenia with paranoid symptoms, pSTS activity during a neutral condition was higher than in patients with autism [ ,  ], highlighting that dysfunction in right pSTS is not only a reliably assessable trait but might be specific to schizophrenia. Thus, there is extensive evidence supporting the idea that hyperfunctioning of pSTS to neutral social stimuli represents an endophenotype for schizophrenia. 

Despite the reported studies consistently finding genotype effects on brain activation and connectivity [ ,  ], they, like this study, tested only one risk SNP’s effect. In addition, since genetic penetrance is higher for endophenotypes than phenotypes [ ]; i.e., significant association between the risk allele and right pSTS functioning, but no significant association between the risk allele and schizotypy, several approaches would be of interest for future studies to validate our findings and to investigate the proposed mechanisms: (a) investigating the load of risk SNPs to reveal biological subcategories of schizophrenia [ ], (b) due to unequal distribution of risk-allele presence (only 11 participants homozygous for the non-risk allele), replication of the finding with pre-selection of participants depending on their genotype, (c) replicating the marginally significant association of positive symptoms and right pSTS activation with different approaches to assess schizotypy, such as the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences [ ], (d) targeting not only right pSTS activation and connectivity, but also of further regions that are central for social-cognitive processing (e.g., amygdala, MPFC). Besides, some previous studies only reported hypo-functioning in the pSTS with regard to schizophrenia in response to higher-level social cognition (such as ToM) [ ,  ]. Whether these studies would also reveal pSTS hyperfunctioning if the neutral condition was investigated remains an open question. However, investigating pSTS hyperactivation in participants with schizophrenia risk can be challenging, because no significant pSTS activation in response to the neutral conditions is found across all participants, pointing to small effect sizes that warrant moderate to large sample sizes to reveal the effects. Moreover, some studies suggest aberrations in left pSTS instead of the right pSTS presenting an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia [ ,  ]. Perner et al. [ ] proposed that the left pSTS is linked to perspective differences for mental and nonmental objects, while the right pSTS is associated with mental states. Future studies should approach the question of laterality with a systematic variation of social-cognitive processing to clarify the functioning of this region in schizophrenia. 

Taken together, our findings point to right pSTS hyperfunctioning in response to neutral faces as an endophenotype of schizophrenia. We assume that right pSTS hyperfunctioning presents a vulnerability to perceive neutral social stimuli as emotionally or intentionally salient and suggest that bottom-up and top-down aberrations interact to cause delusions via deficient social perception.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Recent behavioural evidence shows that visual displays of two individuals interacting are not simply encoded as separate individuals, but as an interactive unit that is 'more than the sum of its parts'. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence shows the importance of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in processing human social interactions, and suggests that it may represent human-object interactions as qualitatively 'greater' than the average of their constituent parts. The current study aimed to investigate whether the pSTS or other posterior temporal lobe region(s): 1) Demonstrated evidence of a dyadic information effect - that is, qualitatively different responses to an interacting dyad than to averaged responses of the same two interactors, presented in isolation, and; 2) Significantly differentiated between different types of social interactions. 

Multivoxel pattern analysis was performed in which a classifier was trained to differentiate between qualitatively different types of dyadic interactions. Above-chance classification of interactions was observed in 'interaction selective' pSTS-I and extrastriate body area (EBA), but not in other regions of interest (i.e. face-selective STS and mentalizing-selective temporo-parietal junction). A dyadic information effect was not observed in the pSTS-I, but instead was shown in the EBA; that is, classification of dyadic interactions did not fully generalise to averaged responses to the isolated interactors, indicating that dyadic representations in the EBA contain unique information that cannot be recovered from the interactors presented in isolation. These findings complement previous observations for congruent grouping of human bodies and objects in the broader lateral occipital temporal cortex area. 
   Highlights  
  
pSTS and EBA classify between different dynamic interactions.

## Introduction 
  
Social interactions are ubiquitous, yet little research has investigated visual perceptual responses to these common social scenarios, relative to individual-person perception ( ). Interestingly, recent behavioural evidence demonstrates that visual responses to two human individuals that are positioned to imply an interaction evoke different responses than when not positioned in this manner. These effects are demonstrated most strikingly by the findings of  : In this study, subjects viewed pairs of briefly presented (30 ms) human bodies or control objects (i.e. chairs), that either faced   towards   or   away   from each other, in either upright or inverted orientation, and were instructed to respond to the stimulus category they saw (i.e. bodies or chairs). Greater recognition accuracy was shown for upright than inverted dyads when an interaction was implied by the two bodies facing towards each other, but crucially, not when facing away from each other. Similarly, visual search facilitation is shown for full body dyads that are positioned to   face towards   – rather than   away   from – each other ( ), while facing direction effects are shown to modulate the evaluation of facial emotion of a target face (i.e. the perceived emotional expression of a target face is modulated by the emotion of a simultaneously presented non-target face, but only when positioned to   face towards   the target;  ). 

Together, these behavioural findings demonstrate that interacting individuals are not merely perceived as separate individuals, but as an   interactive dyad  . Indeed, similar   non-linear   neural responses have been observed recently – that is,   that responses to dyadic interaction stimuli are not the same as a linear combination of responses to the isolated elements of an interaction  . Specifically,   demonstrated evidence of non-linear responses to human-object interaction stimuli in the posterior temporal cortex; the authors used a pattern classification approach to test whether responses to images of human-object interactions (e.g. a person pushing a shopping cart) are distinct from   the mean-averaged response   to the constituent parts of the interaction (i.e. the averaged response to an isolated human and isolated cart); it was found that voxel patterns for human-object interactions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and lateral occipital cortex (LOC) were statistically distinct from the averaged patterns evoked by isolated ‘interaction parts’. These findings suggest that these regions are sensitive to   unique   interactive information that is accessed only through holistic processing of interactions, and not through part-wise analysis (i.e. processing of constituent ‘interaction parts’ in isolation). 

Interestingly, this response in the pSTS complements previous findings that this region plays an important role in the visual processing of dynamic social interactions; for example, greater pSTS responses are shown for interacting point-light human dyads relative to two non-interacting figures, as well as for similar stimuli depicted by moving geometric shapes that do not contain body information ( ;  ). This region also differentiates between types of interactions performed by live-action human stimuli ( ), and is sensitive to ‘interactive’ motion cues such as the movement contingency between two interacting human figures ( ), or the degree of correlated motion between interacting animate geometric shapes ( ;  ). These findings implicate the pSTS as a region that may be optimized for processing social interaction information. 

The main aim of the present study was to determine whether pSTS encodes dynamic human interactions between two individuals in a non-linear fashion, using a similar approach to  . We herein adopt the phrase ‘  dyadic information effect  ’ rather than ‘non-linear’ effect, to emphasize a   sensitivity to unique information that is only present in dyadic interactions and not the averaged responses evoked by each interactor, presented in isolation  . Specifically, we used support vector machine (SVM) classification to test whether voxel-pattern responses to dyadic stimuli in the pSTS were statistically differentiable from   averaged response patterns   of isolated interactors. Additionally, it was predicted that significantly differentiable responses to   different types   of dyadic interaction would be observed in the pSTS, replicating previous findings (e.g.  ;  ). Responses were also tested in 3 other functionally localized regions of interest (ROIs) that are selective for social information that likely contributes to social interaction processing, and therefore might also plausibly show the hypothesized effects: Extrastriate body area (EBA), mentalizing-selective temporo-parietal junction (TPJ-M), and face-selective STS (STS-F). 


## Material & methods 
  
### Participants 
  
21 right-handed adults (mean age = 23.40 years; SD = 3.74; range = 18–35; 12 females) participated in the study. Participants gave informed consent and received monetary compensation for taking part. Ethical procedures were approved by the Bangor University psychology ethics board. 


### Stimuli 
  
Stimuli consisted of 4 s (s) video clips that were taken from custom footage of paired actors engaging in semi-improvised interactions. Actors were instructed to improvise these scenarios while enacting scripted ‘  action-gestures  ’; for example, for a given arguing scenario, one actor might be instructed to   point angrily   at the other person while the other   shook their fists   in frustration. Therefore, each interaction depicted two individuals performing a given pair of complementary action-gestures that they were encouraged to enact in a natural, authentic way (see supplementary materials A for example videos). An initial set of   dyad stimuli   were created (along with a separate set of   alone stimuli  , as described below; see   for examples of both dyad and alone stimuli). Dyad stimuli depicted two actors engaging in one of 3   interactive scenarios  :   Arguing   (i.e. both actors engaging in an angry/frustrated confrontation),   celebrating   (i.e. both actors celebrating together, excitedly), and   laughing   (i.e. both actors were laughing together, or at each other). These specific scenarios were chosen for the ‘tonal consistency’ of actions performed by a given pair of interactors, such that the intentions, emotions, and valence information conveyed by both individuals in a given scenario were always similar (e.g. angry/frustrated) rather than contrasting (e.g. angry/sad). This ensured that successful classification of the different scenarios was not driven by systematic differences in intentional, emotional, or valence content   between   interactors. Therefore, these scenarios represented three interactive scenarios that were intended to be easily distinguishable.   
a. Example video frames from the dyad versions of the three interaction scenarios. Each row represents one of three unique female-male interactor pairs. b. Two example alone stimuli (created from a given dyad stimulus). 
  Fig. 1   

Within each interaction scenario (e.g. arguing), 4 exemplar videos were created, each using a unique pair of action-gestures, such that each video showed the two individuals performing a complementary pair of action-gestures (e.g. while arguing, interactor A accusatorily points at interactor B who is shaking their hands in frustration). Importantly, no gestures were ‘reused’ in any of the other action-gesture pairings (i.e. a total of 8 action gestures were used across the 4 exemplar videos for each scenario). Similarly, 3 different female-male   interactor pairs   enacted these scenarios, yielding a total of 36 dyad stimuli: 3 interaction scenarios (arguing, celebrating, laughing) x 4 unique action-gesture pairings x 3 interactor pairs. The final stimuli were chosen from a wider set of stimuli based on the highest ‘interactive-ness’ and ‘naturalness’ ratings from a pilot study (N = 10; see supplementary materials A). 

For these stimuli, the average horizontal distance between actors was closely matched – the visual angle between the centre of each actor's torso was approximately 4.80°, and actor height ranged between 3.73 and 4.26°. As dynamic facial information is known to activate the STS (e.g.  ), the presence of facial information was controlled such that classification could not be attributed to different facial expressions. Accordingly, these stimuli did not contain high spatial frequency face information, but body information was preserved. To achieve this, a circle-shaped Gaussian blur mask was placed on each of the actors' heads for each video frame. This preserved the overall shape of the head, preventing the potentially eerie appearance of headless interacting bodies. 

To test neural responses to the same interactive information – but without specifically   dyadic information   (i.e. information available from two interactors presented simultaneously) – a separate set of 72   alone stimuli   were created by removing either individual from each of the 36 dyad stimuli (see  b for examples of two alone stimuli). It is important to note that although these stimuli depicted an isolated interactor by themselves, they still conveyed interactive information (e.g. communicative gesturing towards an implied interactor). Two horizontally-flipped variants of these 108 unique stimuli (36 dyad ​+ ​72 alone stimuli) resulted in a final set of 216 stimuli. 


### Design & procedure 
  
A rapid event-related design was used, and each run was optimized using optseq2 (  http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq  ), based on differentiating 6 conditions (i.e. both dyad and alone variants of the arguing, celebrating, and laughing interaction scenarios), with an inter-stimulus interval range between 0 and 10s (along with 8s fixation at the beginning of each run, and 16 s at the end to capture most of the haemodynamic response). The 6 designs with the highest detection sensitivity were selected to determine event timings for runs. 

Inside the scanner, participants viewed stimuli that were presented centrally on the screen within a 9.17 × 5.11° rectangular space. 6 runs were completed, each lasted exactly 7 minutes and contained 8 stimuli for each dyad version and 16 stimuli for each alone version of each of the 3 scenarios, resulting in 72 experimental stimuli per run. Three important stimulus ordering considerations are also noted here: Firstly, left and right horizontal presentations of each stimulus were balanced within the design, such that any resulting effects could not be attributed to low-level confounds in the horizontal position of interactors (i.e. left and right horizontally-flipped variants of the stimuli appeared equally often); secondly, that any given pair of alone stimuli (i.e. that originated from the same dyad stimulus) were always presented in the same run as each other so that classification of alone stimuli did not contain additional between-run variance that was not present for the dyad stimuli; thirdly, to minimize repetition effects (i.e. seeing the exact same action-gestures from a given dyad stimulus and the corresponding pair of alone stimuli), alone stimuli that appeared in any given run were always from dyad stimuli that were allocated to a different run. 

In addition to the stimuli already described, nine additional catch stimuli were presented (three dyad stimuli, and six alone stimuli) but were not later analysed. These trials contained a ‘frame-freeze’ in which 12 consecutive video frames (duration = 500 ms) were randomly removed from the video and replaced with one repeated frame for that period, creating the impression of a momentary video pause. Participants were instructed to simply watch the videos and to give a button-press response whenever a frame-freeze was detected, and to refrain from making explicit judgements about the interactors. 


### Localizer tasks & ROI creation 
  
Participants completed several localizer tasks in a separate scanning session, on a separate day (see supplementary materials B for full description of these tasks). Briefly explained, three different video tasks were used to localize brain regions that are sensitive to different types of social information: 1) A point-light figure social interaction task similar to that used previously ( ;  ) was used to localize interaction-selective pSTS (pSTS-I) regions of interest (ROI) with the interaction > scrambled interaction contrast (i.e. two intact human figures interacting vs. spatially scrambled versions of the same stimuli in which body and interactive information was disrupted). 2) A dynamic body and face localizer that was adapted from stimuli used previously ( ) – this served to localize body-selective EBA and face-selective STS cortex (i.e. STS-F), with the bodies > objects, and faces > objects contrasts, respectively. 3) A free-viewing animated film (‘Partly Cloudy’; Pixar Animation Studios:   https://www.pixar.com/partly-cloudy  ) identical to that used previously ( ) was used to localize mentalizing-selective TPJ-M with the mentalizing > pain contrast (i.e. mentalizing > pain time-points). 

These tasks allowed for the localization of 4 bilateral subject-specific ROIs (i.e. pSTS-I, EBA, STS-F, & TPJ-M; see supplementary materials C for a visualization of these ROIs). These ROIs were created with a group-constrained definition procedure (e.g.  ) as follows. For a given subject and contrast (e.g. interaction > scrambled interaction, for the pSTS-I), a 5 mm-radius ‘search sphere’ was created by running a whole-brain analysis for N-1 group subjects (i.e. with the ‘current’ subject excluded) and centring the sphere at the peak voxel (i.e. highest t-value) in the designated region. This relatively small sphere was chosen to ensure subject's ROIs did not deviate too far from a given designated anatomical region (e.g. pSTS). To determine the position of the final ROI, a whole-brain analysis for the current subject (for the same contrast) was run, and resulting activation was constrained to the search sphere. A 7 mm-radius sphere was then centred at the peak voxel in this search region; this ROI sphere size was chosen as an ideal compromise between capturing a relatively large number of voxels that would benefit classification performance (e.g.  ), and ensuring minimal overlap between neighbouring STS ROIs. 

All ROIs contained 179 voxels, with the exception of two subjects that had small regions of overlap between the right pSTS-I and right TPJ-M, and a further two subjects with similar overlap between the right pSTS-I and right STS-F. Across these four subjects, a mean overlap of 18 voxels (range: 12–24) was found. To ensure independence of ROI voxels within each of these four subjects, overlapping voxels were removed and ROIs were recreated (respective final ROI sizes for these four subjects were: 167, 161, 161, 155 voxels; all other ROIs for these subjects contained 179 voxels). 


### MRI parameters, pre-processing, & GLM estimation 
  
Scanning was performed with a Philips 3T scanner at Bangor University. Functional images were acquired with the following parameters: T2*-weighted gradient-echo single-shot EPI pulse sequence; TR ​= ​2000 ​ms, TE ​= ​30 ​ms, flip angle ​= ​83°, FOV(mm) ​= ​240 ​× ​240 x 108, acquisition matrix ​= ​80 ​× ​78 (reconstruction matrix ​= ​80); 36 contiguous axial slices were acquired, with a reconstructed voxel size of 3 mm . Four dummy scans were discarded prior to image acquisition for each run. Structural images were obtained with the following parameters: T1-weighted image acquisition using a gradient echo, multi-shot turbo field echo pulse sequence, with a five echo average; TR = 12 ms, average TE = 3.4 ms, in 1.7 ms steps, total acquisition time = 136s, FA = 8°, FOV = 240 × 240, acquisition matrix = 240 × 224 (reconstruction matrix = 240); 128 contiguous axial slices, acquired voxel size (mm) = 1.0 × 1.07 x 2.0 (reconstructed voxel size = 1 mm ). 

Pre-processing was performed with SPM12 (fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12). This entailed slice-timing correction, re-alignment (and re-slicing), co-registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing. All default parameters were used except for a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. General linear model (GLM) estimation was performed in SPM12 on participants’ normalized images. For the main task, whole-brain beta maps were generated on a run-wise basis with events estimated as 6   classification conditions   – both dyad and alone variants of the arguing, celebrating, and laughing stimuli. One further set of maps were created where each event was modelled separately, to allow for stimulus-wise analyses (see supplementary materials D). 


### SVM classification analyses 
  
Leave-one-run-out linear support vector machine (SVM) classification was implemented with CoSMoMVPA ( ). Briefly explained, for a given subject, an SVM classifier was trained on ROI voxels (i.e. beta values) for the conditions of interest (e.g. dyad variants of the arguing, celebrating, and laughing conditions) in all but one run of data – with the ‘left-out’ run of data used to independently test classification performance on. This was iterated 6 times with each run serving as the left-out test run, and classification accuracy was averaged across iterations. These values were then entered into group level   t  -tests. All reported tests were significant at the corrected Bonferroni threshold (α) unless otherwise stated. A different threshold was calculated separately for each set of analyses (i.e. based on 8, 8, & 4 comparisons for dyad, alone, and cross-classification analyses, respectively), as stated in each sub-section in the results. All   t  -test   p-  values are one-tailed. 

This approach was almost identical for both ‘standard’ classification (e.g. between the three dyad conditions, or between the three alone conditions) and   cross-classification   analyses except that the allocation of training and test conditions differed; that is, for cross-classification, the classifier was trained on the three dyad conditions, but   tested   on the three alone conditions. Significant cross-classification demonstrates that the patterns underlying the two sets of conditions are similar to each other, and therefore are largely driven by the same information. However, we reasoned that if a region showed significantly greater dyad classification than cross-classification (i.e. between dyad and alone conditions), this would indicate sensitivity to dyadic information that could not be ‘recovered’ from the individual interactors presented in isolation (i.e. averaged responses to alone stimuli). As explained previously (see section  ) several stimulus ordering constraints were imposed within each run, and importantly, alone stimuli from a given dyad stimulus were always presented in a different run to minimize repetition effects. Notably, this likely resulted in a   more conservative   estimation of the dyadic information effect due to greater similarity between stimuli in test and train data splits for cross-classification, than for ‘standard’ classification (see supplementary materials E for further details). 



## Results 
  
### SVM classification analyses 
  
For each of the 8 functionally localized ROIs, a series of analyses were performed in which a linear SVM classifier was trained and tested on different variants of the 3 interaction scenarios (i.e. arguing, celebrating, and laughing). One-sample   t  -tests were used to determine whether classification accuracy was above chance level (i.e. 100% / 3 categories = 33.3% chance accuracy; Bonferroni corrected α = 0.006). 

Significant above-chance classification of the three interaction scenarios of dyad stimuli (see  ) was observed in the right pSTS-I (Classification accuracy (%):   M   = 41.39,   SD   = 9.10;   t   (19) = 3.96,   p   < .001) and both the right EBA (  M   = 49.38,   SD   = 12.19;   t   (17) = 5.59,   p   < .001) and left EBA (  M   = 50.88,   SD   = 13.00;   t   (18) = 5.88,   p   < .001), and at an uncorrected threshold in the left pSTS-I (  M   = 38.60,   SD   = 10.55;   t   (18) = 2.17,   p   = .022). None of the 4 other ROIs – bilateral STS-F and TPJ-M – showed above-chance classification of the dyad stimuli (all   ps   > .100; see  ; see supplementary materials F for full statistics).

  Fig. 3   

It is possible that significant classification of dyad stimuli in the bilateral pSTS-I and EBA does not completely rely on inherently dyadic information, and may also encode information conveyed by isolated individuals (e.g. interactive gestures directed towards an implied – but physically absent – interaction partner). To test if this was true, another classification analysis (Bonferroni corrected α = 0.006) was run to see if these regions could differentiate the three interaction scenarios for the alone stimuli (see  ,  ). It is worth reiterating that the   same overall information   was present as in the dyad classification analysis (i.e. same scenarios, actors, & gestures). Above-chance classification was shown in right pSTS-I (  M   = 43.33,   SD   = 12.57;   t   (19) = 3.56,   p   = .001) but only marginally in left pSTS-I (  M   = 37.43,   SD   = 12.81;   t   (18) = 1.39,   p   = .090). Both right EBA (  M   = 46.30,   SD   = 7.86;   t   (17) = 7.00,   p   < .001), and left EBA (  M   = 46.49,   SD   = 6.73;   t   (18) = 8.52,   p   < .001) also showed significant classification. As for dyad classification, bilateral STS-F and TPJ-M ROIs did not show above-chance classification (all   ps   > .088), and therefore, these regions were excluded from further analyses. 

Together, these two classification analyses demonstrate interaction sensitive responses in the right pSTS-I and bilateral EBA regions, and to a marginal extent in the left pSTS-I; specifically, these regions were able to differentiate between the three different interaction scenarios, both when observing an intact dyad and when observing the same constituent interactors presented in isolation. However, although these regions are sensitive to both modes of presentation, this does not mean that the underlying information driving classification in both dyadic and alone scenarios is the same (e.g. information about the spatial-relations between interactors may contribute to classification of the dyad stimuli, but not the alone stimuli). Indeed, if voxel pattern classification in any region does not fully generalise from dyad stimuli to the alone stimuli, this would suggest that there is information encoded by these regions during dyadic interaction perception that cannot be recovered by the same information presented in the alone stimuli. 

Next, a cross-classification analysis was implemented (Bonferroni corrected α = 0.013) whereby an SVM classifier was trained to discriminate responses to the three interaction scenarios with the dyad stimuli, but performance was tested on responses to the alone stimuli. Significant cross-classification was shown for all 4 ROIs (right pSTS-I:   M   = 41.39,   SD   = 8.92;   t   (19) = 4.04,   p   < .001; left pSTS-I:   M   = 40.64,   SD   = 9.63;   t   (18) = 3.31,   p   = .002; right EBA:   M   = 43.21,   SD   = 7.75;   t   (17) = 5.40,   p   < .001; left EBA:   M   = 46.20,   SD   = 11.27;   t   (18) = 4.97,   p   < .001), demonstrating that these regions encode similar information in both the dyad and alone stimuli. 

To test for the main hypothesis (i.e. a dyadic information effect) paired   t  -tests were then performed (Bonferroni corrected α = 0.013) between dyad classification accuracy scores and cross-classification accuracy scores. No difference was observed for either the right pSTS-I (  t   (19) = 0.00,   p   = .500) or left pSTS-I (  t   (18) = −0.73,   p   = .763), showing no dyadic information effect, indicating that the main hypothesis was not supported. However, significantly greater accuracy for dyad classification than cross-classification was shown in the right EBA at an uncorrected level (  t   (17) = 2.07,   p   = .027). A similar, although weaker, marginal effect was also shown in the left EBA (  t   (18) = 1.52,   p   = .073). Therefore, evidence suggestive of a dyadic information effect was shown in the bilateral EBA only. 

To determine whether regions outside the functionally defined ROIs demonstrated a dyadic information effect, whole-brain searchlight analyses ( ) were performed (see supplementary materials G for a full description of searchlight methods and results). Peak classification accuracies (i.e. for dyad and alone classification separately, and also for cross-classification) were observed in the bilateral lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC) and pSTS, along with weaker responses in other areas. However, no dyadic information effects were observed in the LOTC/EBA for this analysis (or in any other brain region), further demonstrating the subtle nature of the effect in the ROI analysis. 


### Reliability of the dyadic information effect in EBA 
  
Due to the marginal nature of these results in the EBA, several follow up tests were performed to determine the reliability of this effect. First, Cohen's   d   effect-sizes were calculated for both the right and left EBA. A medium effect-size was found for the right EBA (  d   = 0.60), and a small-to-medium effect was shown in the left EBA (  d   = 0.38). 

To ensure that these effects were not spuriously driven by the ‘direction’ of cross-classification training and testing roles, cross-classification was performed again, but with the training and testing roles reversed. That is, the classifier was now trained on the   alone   stimuli and tested on the   dyad   stimuli. Both right EBA (  M   = 43.83, SD = 7.60;   t   (17) = 5.86,   p   < .001) and left EBA (  M   = 46.20, SD = 10.32;   t   (17) = 5.43,   p   < .001) showed significant cross-classification. Crucially, dyadic information effects were replicated; greater accuracy for dyad classification than cross-classification was again shown in the right EBA (  t   (17) = 2.03,   p   = .029;   d   = 0.55) and marginally in the left EBA (  t   (18) = 1.41,   p   = .088;   d   = 0.40). 

One further test was performed to determine how reliable these effects were across different ROI sizes (i.e. in addition to the original 7 mm radius ROIs, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, & 12 mm radius ROIs were created). Consistent with the dyadic information effect in the in the original right EBA ROI, greater accuracy for dyad classification than cross-classification was shown across all ROI sizes, but was most pronounced in larger ROIs (i.e.   ps   < .05 for 8, 9, 11, & 12 mm radii; see supplementary materials H). By contrast, in the left EBA, the dyadic information trend was only shown for smaller ROI sizes (i.e. 5 mm radius:   p   < .05; 6 and 7 mm radii: marginal   ps   ≤ .073); indeed, these hemispheric differences appear to be consistent with larger regions of body selectivity in the right than left EBA as previously reported ( ). 


### Results summary 
  
In summary, although right pSTS-I – and marginally, left pSTS-I – differentiated between the three interaction scenarios, no evidence for specific   dyadic information   encoding was observed in these regions. Instead, this effect was observed in the right EBA at an uncorrected threshold (the data for this analysis are available to download; see supplementary materials I). Follow-up analyses demonstrated that this effect was reliable and interpretable, and is further supported by similar (although weaker) effects in left EBA. Control analyses revealed that these effects are not accounted for by low-level differences in stimulus motion energy between conditions (see supplementary materials J). Additionally, exploratory representational similarity analyses were also performed to further characterize EBA responses to dyad and alone stimuli (see supplementary materials D). 



## Discussion 
  
### Overview of results 
  
The present study aimed to determine whether the pSTS – or any other posterior temporal lobe region – showed sensitivity to   unique   dyadic information in visually observed interactive scenarios that is not present for isolated individual interactors. Two main findings were shown: 1) EBA – but not pSTS – showed evidence consistent with the encoding of unique dyadic information; 2) pSTS (and EBA) classified between three interaction scenarios (i.e. arguing, celebrating, & laughing) replicating similar differentiation of types of interactions between abstract moving shapes ( ;  ). 


### Interaction classification in the pSTS & EBA 
  
Specifically, which type of information might drive differentiation of interaction scenarios in the pSTS and EBA? The pSTS plays an important role in biological motion perception (e.g.  ;  ;  ), and is strongly responsive to movement contingencies between interacting figures (e.g.  ), as well as dynamic cues that imply interactive behaviour between animate moving shapes ( ;  ). Similarly, the pSTS is also sensitive to the intentional contents of actions ( ;  ;  ). It therefore seems plausible that classification in the pSTS is driven by differential intentional content between interaction scenarios that is extracted from different dynamic contingencies between interactors. 

Additionally, the EBA also classified between interaction scenarios. A direct interpretation of this result is that body posture information contributes strongly to the differentiation of these three scenarios. EBA is shown to be sensitive to dynamic postural information (i.e. continuous sequences of body postures that form coherent actions) and is suggested to encode body-based actions ( ). In the current study, distinctively different sequences of coherent body postures – or action-gestures – may have driven classification of interaction scenarios. Although distinct action-gestures were used within each interactive scenario, these tended to be relatively similar to each other (e.g. arguing gestures usually depicted short, sharp movements, while laughing gestures typically contained convulsive torso movements). Therefore, it seems possible that classification of interaction scenarios in the EBA was likely the result of similar action-gestures   within   each scenario, that were markedly different   across   the three scenarios. 


### No dyadic information effect in the pSTS 
  
Despite the pSTS classifying interactive scenarios, the main prediction was not supported; no   dyadic information effect   was observed for the pSTS. This contrasts with the findings of   that showed an analogous effect in the pSTS for static depictions of human-object (inter)actions compared to the averaged responses to isolated objects and humans. One possible explanation for this concerns STS sensitivity to implied biological motion in static images ( ;  ); static human-object interactions might imply greater biological motion or more effortful movement that is not ‘recoverable’ from isolated human and objects; for example, an image of a person pushing a cart implies greater movement than the same body pose and cart presented separately, by virtue of greater physical effort required to move the cart, along with the corresponding impression that the cart is moving. Additionally, pSTS sensitivity to causal contingencies (e.g. a billiard ball hitting another, causing a transfer in motion;  ) suggests the strong influence of physical contact in human-object interactions that was not present in the isolated stimuli. By contrast, the current study used dynamic stimuli that contained biological motion information but no physical contact, and as such, the dyad and alone stimuli were closely matched for these two sources of information that might have driven responses to the stimuli used by  . 

Although no dyadic information effect was found in the pSTS, it is important to note that interactive information was still conveyed in the alone stimuli (e.g. communicative gesturing to an unseen interactive partner was strongly implied). Therefore, successful classification of the alone stimuli does not necessarily reflect that pSTS responses are non-interactive. Indeed, in the context of the sorts of gestural interactions used in the current study, it is possible that classification of the alone and dyad stimuli relied on the same cues (i.e. communicative gestures). Similarly, the current data supports the possibility that representations of interactions in this region may encode the presence of two interactors in a linear fashion (i.e. dyad = the average of the two individuals). Alternatively, it is possible that the pSTS responses to both dyad and alone stimuli are driven by interactive gestures ‘directed’ at another individual, regardless of whether the other individual is present or not. 


### Dyadic information processing in the EBA 
  
Although not observed for the pSTS, a dyadic information effect was shown for the right EBA and to a lesser extent, the left EBA. Although not predicted, this does fit with previous findings observed in the wider LOTC area. Specifically,   observed differentiable responses to human-object interactions than averaged responses to humans and objects in object-selective LOTC (i.e. LOC – in close proximity to EBA); however, this trend did not quite reach significance in the EBA, likely due to weaker responses to object stimuli, suggesting that the currently observed EBA responses could be specific to human body information. Recent evidence also shows that object-selective LOTC is sensitive to ‘regular’ spatial configurations of objects that imply a congruent scene (e.g. different responses are shown for scenes that depict a sofa positioned in front of a television, rather than behind it;  ). Similarly, object-selective LOTC is sensitive to spatial configurations of objects that imply an action (e.g. a pitcher tilted towards an empty cup), relative to configurations that do not ( ). 

Broadly, these findings might suggest a converging role for configural processing of   distinct   objects and people in the LOTC. In relation to the present findings, it is conceivable that LOTC – and here the EBA specifically – performs similar configural processing or grouping based on the action-, body-, and movement information conveyed by interactors. If true, to what extent does   dynamic   information contribute to this effect? In contrast to previous work investigating LOTC grouping responses for static stimuli ( ;  ;  ), the current study used dynamic stimuli. Although the EBA is highly sensitive to static pose information, and may process body movements as a series of static ‘snapshots’ ( ;  ) body (and face) responses are shown to generalise across static and dynamic depictions in broad regions of the posterior temporal cortex ( ). Similarly, representations in the LOTC generalise across dynamic and static depictions of actions and are invariant to other low-level features such as movement direction, or the specific hand used to perform an action ( ;  ). 

In line with these findings, it is likely that dyadic representations of (inter)actions in the EBA generalise across static-dynamic depictions. While dynamic information may not be necessary to encode such scenarios, it may, potentially, allow for more elaborate encoding of body-based actions than similar, static depictions. Additionally, other spatial cues (e.g. interpersonal distance, physical contact, and facing direction), and temporal cues (e.g. movement contingencies and correlated motion) may also contribute to dyadic encoding in the EBA, and further research may directly clarify which cues contribute most prominently. 

It is also worth briefly considering the extent to which dyadic information processing is present for other types of interaction, for example, interactions depicted by moving geometric shapes that do not contain body information. These types of stimuli are known to drive responses in LOTC, ostensibly due to the presence of simple actions such as pushing and pulling movements ( ). As mentioned previously, the wider LOTC area shows some sensitivity to spatial-temporal relations between interacting or scene entities, and therefore cortex in close proximity to (and overlapping with) EBA might plausibly encode dyadic information for these abstract scenarios. 

The present stimuli consisted of interactions between individuals that did not involve physical contact, a potentially powerful interaction cue that is worthy of further investigation; indeed, stronger dyadic information effects might be predicted for contact-based interactions (e.g. two individuals shaking hands), by virtue of categorical differences in physical contact (i.e. presence of physical contact in dyadic interactions vs. absence of physical contact in ‘alone’ variants of these stimuli). 


### Conclusion 
  
In summary, the present results show that both EBA and pSTS differentiate between different types of social interactions. Crucially, representations of dyadic social interactions in the EBA are sensitive to information beyond that which is encoded by the simple average of two separate interactors presented in isolation. This so-called   dyadic information effect   suggests that the EBA is sensitive to unique interactive information that is present only when two individuals interact simultaneously. These findings complement previously observed sensitivity in the wider LOTC area to spatial configurations of objects or bodies that support the processing of holistic, congruent scenarios.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Humans and other primates are adept at using the direction of another's gaze or head turn to infer where that individual is attending. Research in macaque neurophysiology suggests that anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) contains a direction-sensitive code for such social attention cues. By contrast, most human functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report that posterior STS is responsive to social attention cues. It is unclear whether this functional discrepancy is caused by a species difference or by experimental design differences. Furthermore, social attention cues are dynamic in naturalistic social interaction, but most studies to date have been restricted to static displays. In order to address these issues, we used multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data to test whether response patterns in human right STS distinguish between leftward and rightward dynamic head turns. Such head turn discrimination was observed in right anterior STS/superior temporal gyrus (STG). Response patterns in this region were also significantly more discriminable for head turn direction than for rotation direction in physically matched ellipsoid control stimuli. Our findings suggest a role for right anterior STS/STG in coding the direction of motion in dynamic social attention cues.

## Introduction 
  
Humans and other primates share a remarkable ability to accurately perceive where other individuals are attending and use this information to change their own attentional state ( ). Many higher order social cognitive processes depend on such gaze following behaviors ( ;  ). Although changes to gaze direction and head view are inherently dynamic, to date the majority of human neuroimaging research has used static facial stimuli to study the neural representation of such social cues ( ). In view of macaque neurophysiology evidence that neurons responsive to dynamic head turns do not respond to static views of the same head ( ), it is vital to explore the neural coding of dynamic social stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that a region in human superior temporal sulcus (STS)/superior temporal gyrus (STG) contains a distributed representation of perceived head turn direction, thus supplying a necessary perceptual component to support a range of social behaviors. 

Neurons in macaque anterior STS play a well-established role in representing the perceived direction of others' social attention cues, as conveyed by head orientation, gaze direction, and body posture ( ,  ;  ;  ). However, these constitute only a minority of visually responsive STS neurons and are either spatially distributed ( ) or are organized into fine-grained patches well beyond the resolution of conventional functional MRI (fMRI;  ). This distributed representation poses a significant signal-to-noise challenge for attempts to study similar effects with human fMRI, where each voxel likely samples millions of neurons in ways that are only indirectly related to the neuronal spike trains commonly measured in macaque neurophysiology ( ;  ). 

Unlike the typical anterior STS region identified by research in the macaque, most human fMRI studies report that social attention cues activate posterior STS and regions of adjacent STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG;  ;  ). Similar posterior temporal regions are also more responsive to faces than to control stimuli ( ;  ). Most of these studies find that posterior STS is more responsive to averted than to direct gaze ( ), but the opposite pattern has also been observed (e.g.,  ;  ). Furthermore, posterior STS responds more when an actor gazes away from a target than when the gaze direction is congruent with the target location ( ), suggesting that posterior STS is influenced by contextual effects, rather than by the direction of the social attention cue as such. Even in the absence of overt contextual manipulations, comparisons between direct and averted gaze may indirectly manipulate the engagement of approach/avoidance mechanisms and other higher order social cognitive functions associated with direct and averted gaze, such as theory of mind responses to eye contact ( ;  ;  ). Thus, the litmus test for direction sensitivity is whether brain responses to different averted social attention cues can be distinguished in the absence of other contextual manipulations. 

When such tests for direction sensitivity between different averted cues were carried out, one study found direction-sensitive fMRI adaptation to static images of gaze cues in right anterior, rather than posterior, STS ( ). Another study that applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to a posterior STS region of interest (ROI) observed no distinction between different averted views of static heads ( ) but did find that this ROI distinguished direct from averted head views across different head identities, suggesting an identity-invariant representation. These head view effects are consistent with the pattern of univariate sensitivity for direct against averted gaze observed in previous univariate research ( ). Considered collectively, this literature suggests a broad role for posterior STS in representing social attention cues, but unlike the evidence from macaque anterior STS, there is little indication that posterior STS represents such cues in a direction-sensitive manner. 

Outside the laboratory, cues to another's focus of attention are intrinsically dynamic in nature, but this issue has received limited attention in controlled experiments. There is initial evidence that a small subset of neurons in macaque anterior STS are tuned to dynamic changes in head turn direction ( ;  ), but it remains unclear how the human brain codes such stimuli. In humans, posterior STS responds more to dynamic head turns than to both scrambled controls and static head views. However, neither anterior nor posterior STS has been found to show direction-sensitive coding of head turn direction, as measured by standard univariate fMRI ( ). This absence of direction sensitivity is unsurprising, since neurons with such responses are unlikely to be clustered at a sufficiently large spatial scale to be detectable with univariate fMRI ( ;  ). 

MVPA has recently been applied to detect representations thought to be coded in fine-grained patterns beyond the resolution of standard fMRI ( ;  ;  ). In the current study, we apply this method to determine whether distributed response patterns in the human STS region contain distinct direction-sensitive codes for observed head turns. If a classifier can use response patterns from the STS region to distinguish between leftward and rightward head turns, this would suggest that the underlying response patterns code head turn direction. However, leftward and rightward motion can also produce classification effects in regions without selectivity for social attention cues ( ). In order to avoid such confounding contributions of low-level motion, we included a set of rotating ellipsoid control videos. Previous work investigating head turn responses in macaque neurophysiology ( ;  ) or direction-specific responses to static gaze ( ) did not include such nonsocial controls, so an important aim of the current study was to establish that any direction-sensitive effects are specific to the social stimuli. Furthermore, we aimed to localize pattern effects to specific regions through the use of a searchlight algorithm that operated within the anatomically defined STS region. The STS region in this study included STG and MTG, in line with previous findings that social perception and gaze stimuli produce peaks that sometimes fall outside the STS proper ( ;  ). 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty-one right-handed healthy volunteers with normal or corrected to normal vision participated in the study (12 males, mean age 29 years, age range 22–38). Volunteers provided informed consent as part of a protocol approved by the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee. Four volunteers were removed from further analysis: Two due to poor performance at the behavioral task whilst in the scanner (accuracy of less than 50%) and 2 due to fatigue and excessive head movements. 


### Experimental Design 
  
Volunteers viewed 1000-ms video clips of 45° leftward and rightward head turns and comparable ellipsoid rotations ( ; e.g., videos, see   Supplementary Material  ). Volunteers were instructed to monitor the stimulus set for infrequent deviant response trials (1 of the 8 experimental videos, rotated 4° from the upright position) and responded to detected deviants with a button press. The deviant response trials were drawn from all experimental conditions, and the degree of rotation was chosen after behavioral pilot tests to produce an attentionally demanding task without ceiling effects. 
  
Example video frames for turning heads (  A  –  B  ) and rotating ellipsoids (  C  –  D  ). The stimuli were full color but are presented in grayscale for printing purposes (for full color stimuli, see   Supplementary Videos  ). The videos were presented at 24 frames per second. All video frames are from leftward motion conditions. Rightward conditions were created through mirror reversal of the same video clips. The 2 ellipsoid identities (  C  –  D  ) were created by Fourier-scrambling face textures from the first frame of the 2 head videos (  A  –  B  ). 
  
Two actors with matched head motion patterns were selected for the head turn videos. The ellipsoid control stimuli were rendered and animated in Matlab (Mathworks) and were texture mapped with the Fourier-scrambled face textures from the 2 head identities. The 2 motion directions were created by mirror reversing video clips with a single direction, thus ensuring that the stimulus set was physically matched across motion directions. This produced a total of 8 stimuli (2 heads, 2 ellipsoids, each rotating leftward or rightward), which were treated as individual conditions. 

The stimuli were back-projected onto a screen in the scanner, which volunteers viewed via a tilted mirror. The stimuli were presented on a black background within a circular aperture (7° visual angle in diameter). The experiment was controlled using Matlab and the Psychophysics toolbox ( ). 

The experiment was divided into sets of 240 trials, each of which was independently randomized. Parameter estimates from each set formed an independent set of training examples for classification. The trials were presented within a rapid event-related design. Four volunteers completed a 6-set version of the experiment (approximately 40 min effective time) and 13 completed a 12-set version (80 min). Each set contained 240 trials: 80 null trials, where a fixation cross remained on the screen throughout the trial (1500 ms) and 160 experimental trials (80 heads, 80 ellipsoids), where each trial consisted of a video clip (1000 ms) followed by fixation (500 ms). Each condition was repeated 18 times in a set. Sixteen deviant response trials were randomly sampled from the experimental conditions and responses to these trials were modeled with a separate nuisance regressor of no interest. The trials within the set were presented in a pseudorandomized order, where repeats of the same trial were slightly clustered in order to increase design efficiency ( ). Every second set was followed by a 15-s rest period, which was cued by a text prompt on the screen. The scan acquisition continued during the rest periods, and volunteers were instructed to remain still. 


### Imaging Acquisition 
  
Scanning was carried out at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, United Kingdom, using a 3-T TIM Trio Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner (Siemens), with a head coil gradient set. Functional data were collected using high-resolution echo planar   T  -weighted imaging (EPI, 40 oblique axial slices, time repetition [TR] 2490 ms, time echo [TE] 30 ms, in-plane resolution 2 × 2 mm, slice thickness 2 mm plus a 25% slice gap, 192 × 192 mm field of view). The acquisition window was tilted up approximately 30° from the horizontal plane to provide complete coverage of the occipital and temporal lobes. Preliminary pilot tests suggested that the use of this high-resolution EPI sequence resulted in reduced signal dropout in the anterior STS region, relative to a standard resolution sequence (3 × 3 × 3.75 mm voxels). All volumes were collected in a single continuous run for each volunteer. The initial 6 volumes from each run were discarded to allow for   T   equilibration effects.   T  -weighted structural images were also acquired (magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo, 1 mm isotropic voxels). 


### Imaging Analysis 
  
Imaging data were processed using statistical parametric mapping 5 (SPM5;   www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ). All functional volumes were realigned to the first nondiscarded volume, slice time corrected, and coregistered to the   T   structural volume. The processing pathways for univariate analysis and MVPA diverged after these common steps ( ). 
  
Processing pathways for fMRI analysis. All processing nodes take the result of the previous node in the hierarchy as input. With the exception of the searchlight classification analysis, all processing steps were implemented using standard SPM5 functionality. 
  
Univariate analysis was carried out using standard processing steps in SPM5. Structural volumes were segmented into gray and white matter partitions and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using combined segmentation and normalization routines. Functional volumes were normalized according to the parameters of this transformation, smoothed (10-mm full width at half mean Gaussian kernel, FWHM), and high pass filtered to remove low frequency drift (128-s cutoff period). 

Subject-specific generalized linear models were used to analyze the data. The models included one regressor per condition and nuisance regressors for deviant response trials, volunteer responses to nondeviant trials, and for nulling scans that contained excessive noise or movement ( ;  ; greater than 10 units intensity difference from the mean scaled image variance or more than 0.3 mm translational or 0.035 radians rotational movement relative to the previous volume). The volunteer-specific models included 0–135 such scan nulling regressors (mean 35). The experimental predictors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, and contrast images were generated based on the fitted responses. These contrast images were then entered into second-level permutation-based random effects models using statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM;  ; 10 000 permutations, 10-mm FWHM variance smoothing). 

Multivariate pattern analyses were carried out using functional volumes that had been realigned and slice timing corrected but had not been spatially normalized to the MNI template ( ). Each volunteer's data were modeled using a generalized linear model with similar regressors as in the univariate analysis, with the exception that each set of trials was modeled using a separate set of regressors. Individual parameter volumes from the first half of the data set was then averaged pairwise with the corresponding volume from the second half of the data set, thus reducing session effects at the expense of halving the number of training examples. This produced 3 or 6 final sets of examples to be used for classification, depending on the number of available sets before averaging. The example volumes were   z  -scored so that each voxel within a set had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 across examples in that set. Finally, each example was gray matter masked using the tissue probability maps generated by the segmentation processing stage. 

The resulting example volumes were used as input to a linear support vector machine classifier (as implemented in PyMVPA;  ). All MVPA used a searchlight algorithm ( ), in which classification is carried out within a spherical region (5 mm radius) that is moved through the volume. Leave-one-out cross-validated classification accuracy estimates (percent correct) were mapped back to the center of each searchlight, thus producing a classification accuracy map. 

The classification accuracy maps for each volunteer were normalized to MNI space, smoothed (10-mm FWHM), and entered into second-level nonparametric random effects models in SnPM. We used nonparametric tests because the discontinuous nature of the gray matter–masked data means that conventional familywise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons using random field theory in SPM5 would be inappropriate. We also wished to avoid making distributional assumptions about the first-level classification accuracy maps. 

In line with the hypothesized site of our effects, we restricted our primary analysis to the right STS region, which was defined anatomically by the first author based on the mean   T   volume for the sample. In line with previous evidence that social perception and eye gaze effects in the STS region extend into STG and MTG ( ;  ), the mask included these gyri, whilst leaving out voxels in inferior temporal sulcus (inferior) or lateral fissure (superior) (  Supplementary Fig. 1  ). We report   P   values corrected for multiple comparisons (FWE,   P   < 0.05) within this ROI (5162 voxels,   y   −58 to 22 mm MNI). We also carried out an exploratory analysis in a mirror-reversed version of the STS mask to test for effects in left STS. The use of a mirror-reversed mask sacrifices some anatomical precision in left STS but preserves the same voxel count and spatial structure in both masks. Visual inspection of the relation between the left STS mask and the mean   T   volume suggested that the mask followed the anatomy of the sulcus in a comparable manner to the right STS mask. Finally, effects that survived correction for the full volume are also reported (FWE,   P   < 0.05). All analyses were restricted to a group gray matter mask, which was formed by the union of each volunteer's normalized individual gray matter mask. This mask ensured that we only considered effects in regions actually covered by the searchlight analysis. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral Task 
  
Volunteers were asked to detect the occasional 4° rotation of the video stimuli and were able to detect such deviant response trials adequately (mean accuracy 71%, standard error 4%). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of accuracy scores with the factors of stimulus type (head, ellipsoid) and motion direction (leftward, rightward) yielded no main effects and no interaction (  F   < 2.4,   P   > 0.14 for all effects), suggesting that volunteers did not assign attention differently to the heads and ellipsoids or to the 2 motion directions. 


### Multivariate Pattern Analysis 
  
#### Superior Temporal Sulcus 
  
Our primary hypothesis was that the right anterior STS region distinguishes between leftward and rightward perceived head turns. In line with this prediction, a group analysis of the MVPA searchlight results for the right STS region showed that classification of head turn direction was significantly more accurate than expected by chance in a right anterior STS/STG site (  P   = 0.005 FWE, 50 4 −14 mm MNI,  ; for individual subject results, see   Supplementary Fig. 2  ). By comparison, left–right classification of rotation direction in the ellipsoid control stimuli exceeded chance in middle STS (  P   = 0.037 FWE, 50 −14 −10 mm MNI,  ). 
  
Group results for MVPA, displayed on the mean   T   volume for the sample. Effects are displayed corrected for multiple comparisons within the right STS region (panels   A  –  C  ; hypothesis-driven analysis,   P   < 0.05 FWE) or the full gray matter volume (panels   D  –  F  ; exploratory analysis,   P   < 0.05 FWE). The highlighted portion of each panel shows the extent of the mask. (  A  ) Classification of left–right head turns in the right STS/STG region. (  B  ) Classification of left–right ellipsoid rotations in the right STS region. (  C  ) Right STS regions where left–right classification of head turns was more accurate than classification of ellipsoid rotations. (  D  ) Classification of left–right head turns in the full gray matter volume. (  E  ): Gray matter regions where left–right classification of head turns was more accurate than classification of ellipsoid rotations. (  F  ) Gray matter regions where the weights acquired by training the classifier on left–right head turns for one head identity generalized to left–right head turns in the other head identity. 
  
The peaks of these head turn and ellipsoid rotation effects were approximately 18 mm apart and the activated regions did not overlap, which raises the question of how distinct the 2 effects are. We addressed this by computing the difference between the classification maps for head turn and ellipsoid rotation in each volunteer. These difference maps were entered into a group analysis, which showed that left–right classification was more accurate for head turns than for ellipsoid rotations in right anterior STS/STG (  P   = 0.027 FWE, 52 12 −12 mm MNI,  ). This effect overlapped with the head turn classification effect (8 mm distance between peaks, 40% overlap), suggesting a common origin. No STS region showed significantly more accurate direction classification for ellipsoid rotations than for head turns. 

We tested whether the left–right head turn codes were invariant to head identity by training the classifier on the left–right turns of one head and applying the learned weights to left–right turns of the other head. Left–right classification did not generalize across head identity at any site in right STS. Similarly, there was no significant left–right generalization across ellipsoid identities and no left–right generalization across stimulus type (head and ellipsoid). 

We also carried out an exploratory analysis of effects in the left anatomically defined STS region. No left STS regions showed above-chance classification of observed head turn direction. However, a region in left anterior STS distinguished ellipsoid rotation direction with above-chance accuracy (  P   = 0.01 FWE, −56 −8 −16 mm MNI,   Supplementary Fig. 3  A   ). Direction classification accuracy was significantly higher for ellipsoid rotation than for head turns in a similar region (  P   = 0.041 FWE, −58 −4 −16 mm MNI,   Supplementary Fig. 3  B   ). No other classification effects were significant in this ROI. 


#### Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
Beyond our hypothesis-driven search within the anatomically defined right STS region, we also carried out an exploratory analysis within the full gray matter–masked volume to identify other effects of interest. Classification of left–right head turns exceeded chance in a region including calcarine sulcus and occipital pole (  P   < 0.001 FWE, 16 −96 0 mm MNI,  ). This region is likely to include visual areas V1, V2, and V3, but in the absence of a retinotopic localizer, we use the general term early visual cortex to describe this region. Left–right ellipsoid classification did not produce significant effects in any region. Left–right classification was significantly more accurate for head turns than for ellipsoid rotations in a similar early visual region (  P   < 0.001 FWE, 14 −96 2 mm MNI,  ). A similar region in early visual cortex also allowed left–right classification to generalize across head identities (  P   < 0.001 FWE, 14 −96 2 mm MNI,  ) but not across stimulus types. No regions outside of early visual cortex showed significant effects for any of these comparisons. 



### Univariate Analysis 
  
We used a conventional univariate analysis in SPM5 to address whether the observed classification effects could be attributed to large-scale response level differences between the conditions. To make comparisons between MVPA and univariate results simpler, the univariate analysis also used nonparametric permutation-based random effects analysis of group effects (SnPM, for details, see Materials and Methods). We also explored whether direction classification of head turns colocalized with greater univariate responses to heads than to ellipsoids. 

#### Superior Temporal Sulcus 
  
No regions inside the anatomically defined right STS ROI responded selectively to one head turn direction over the other or to one ellipsoid rotation direction over the other, suggesting that the left–right classification effects in this region did not co-occur with large-scale univariate direction sensitivity. 

Collapsing across motion direction, right posterior STS responded significantly more to heads than to ellipsoids (  P   < 0.002 FWE, 48 −44 16 mm MNI,  ), while a region in middle STG bordering on the edge of the ROI responded more to ellipsoids than to heads (  P   = 0.004 FWE, 60 0 0 mm MNI,  ). Thus, univariate selectivity for heads over ellipsoids occurred in posterior STS, 57 mm from the left–right head turn classification peak in anterior STS/STG. The peaks for univariate selectivity for ellipsoids over heads and for left–right ellipsoid rotation classification were separated by 20 mm. Neither of the univariate effects overlapped with the classification effects. 
  
Group results for the univariate analysis, displayed on the mean   T   volume for the sample. Effects are displayed corrected for multiple comparisons within the right STS region (panels   A  –  B  ; hypothesis-driven analysis,   P   < 0.05 FWE) or the full gray matter volume (panels   C  –  D  ; exploratory analysis,   P   < 0.05 FWE). The highlighted portion of each panel shows the extent of the mask. (  A  ) Greater univariate responses to heads than to ellipsoids in the right STS region. (  B  ) Greater univariate responses to ellipsoids than to heads in the right STS region. (  C  ) Gray matter regions with greater univariate responses to left than to right head turns (warm colors) or with greater univariate responses to right than to left head turns (cool colors). The effects do not overlap at any site. (  D  ) Gray matter regions with greater univariate responses to heads than to ellipsoids. 
  
Within the left STS ROI, a posterior region responded more to heads than to ellipsoids (  P   = 0.004 FWE, −52 −58 14 mm MNI,   Supplementary Fig. 3  C   ) and left middle STS responded more to ellipsoids than to heads (  P   = 0.014, −66 −18 −14 mm MNI,   Supplementary Fig. 3  D   ), mirroring the results obtained in the right STS region. No left STS regions responded preferentially to head turn or ellipsoid rotation in one direction relative to another. No other comparisons reported above were significant in the left STS analysis. 


#### Whole-Brain Analysis 
  
A univariate analysis of the gray matter–masked full volume revealed significant univariate selectivity for left over right head turns that was restricted to left early visual cortex (  P   < 0.001 FWE, −12 −94 0 mm MNI), and conversely, selectivity for right over left head turns restricted to right early visual cortex (  P   < 0.001 FWE, 14 −92 4 mm MNI,  ). These effects almost completely overlapped the left–right head turn classification effect in early visual cortex (100% overlap for left over right, 91% overlap for right over left), suggesting that the classification effects co-occurred with large-scale univariate effects. Note that the laterality of these early visual effects is opposite to what would be expected for a stimulus that moves into the right and left visual hemifields, a point we return to below. No regions showed a preference for one ellipsoid rotation direction over the other in the whole-brain analysis. 

A comparison of univariate responses to heads over ellipsoids and ellipsoids over heads revealed a network of activations (  Supplementary Table 1  ). Of primary interest to the current study, bilateral early visual cortex responded more to heads than to ellipsoids (  P   < 0.001 FWE, 18 −96 −4 mm MNI,  ), and this early visual effect overlapped the left–right head turn classification effect (91% overlap). Thus, the left–right head turn classification effects occurred in a region where we also observed univariate selectivity for head turn direction and preferential responses to heads over ellipsoids. Bilateral regions in posterior MTG also responded more to heads than to ellipsoids (right:   P   = 0.001 FWE, 52 −74 2 mm MNI. Left:   P   = 0.001 FWE, −50 −72 14 mm MNI). These coordinates are close to those previously reported for motion area MT ( ; conversion from Talairach to MNI coordinates with tools from  ). Because we did not include a specific localizer scan to distinguish MT from MST or other motion areas, we refer to this region as MT+. The MT+ regions showed no direction-sensitive responses in the univariate or classification analyses, even at reduced thresholds (  P   < 0.01, uncorrected). 



### Follow-up Experiments 
  
The pattern of univariate effects in early visual cortex suggested to us the presence of eye movements in the experiment. If volunteers tracked the heads as they turned, this would have placed the stimulus primarily in the hemifield ipsilateral to the direction of motion, which could explain the ipsilateral univariate activations in early visual cortex. Eye tracking was not available when the main experiment was undertaken, so we carried out follow-up eye tracking and fMRI experiments with 3 principal aims: First, to test whether the head turns used in the main experiment elicit eye movements; second, to assess whether the eye movement effects could be removed with a revised experimental paradigm; and finally, to test whether the fMRI effects reported in the main text remained in the absence of statistically significant eye movement effects. 


### Follow-up Materials and Methods 
  
Five volunteers from the final sample used in the main experiment returned to participate in additional experiments. Eye movements were monitored using a video-based infrared eye tracker (500 Hz acquisition outside the scanner, 50 Hz acquisition inside the scanner; Sensomotoric Instruments). We analyzed the change in horizontal fixation position at the end relative to the start of each trial using custom code developed in Matlab. 

Imaging data were acquired and analyzed using identical parameters as in the main experiment, with the exception that no averaging of the first and second half of the experiment was carried out, since this would have yielded an unacceptably small number of observations for first-level statistics. Furthermore, each set was scanned in a separate run to allow recalibration of the eye tracker between sets. As in the main fMRI experiment, we used a searchlight analysis. We based single-volunteer inference on binomial tests at each voxel in the ROI. 


### Follow-up Eye Tracking with the Original Design 
  
Five volunteers carried out an abbreviated version of the main experiment outside the scanner (3 sets, 540 trials), while their eye position was monitored. First-level ANOVAs revealed that each volunteer showed a significant stimulus type (head, ellipsoid) by motion direction (leftward, rightward) interaction (  Supplementary Table 2  ). This interaction reflected consistent fixation shifts in the direction of the head turns, with nonsignificant or weaker fixation shifts in the direction of the ellipsoid rotations. 


### Follow-up Eye Tracking with Revised Design 
  
We carried out a second eye tracking experiment with a revised paradigm that included a fixation cross during the presentation of the video clips. Volunteers were also strongly instructed to maintain fixation at all times. We included only the head turn conditions in order to obtain a maximal number of trials for the head left–right comparison whilst minimizing volunteer fatigue. In this second experiment, the head turn left–right eye movement effect was reduced to nonsignificance in 4 of 5 volunteers ( ). 
  
Follow-up eye tracking and fMRI experiments. (  A  –  C  ) Mean horizontal fixation change plotted separately for the 3 volunteers selected for the final analysis in the revised fMRI experiment. Positive values reflect a leftward shift in fixation over the trial, while negative values reflect a rightward shift. The horizontal axis gives fixation performance in the original task, the revised task, and the revised task as measured during the fMRI experiment. The error bars give ±1 standard error of the mean. Comparisons with significant differences between the head turn directions are highlighted by asterisks (  t  -tests,   P   < 0.05). It can be seen that the revised design abolished the eye movement effect in these volunteers. (  D  –  F  ) Left–right head turn classification results for the 3 volunteers in the final sample of the fMRI experiment. The volunteers are shown in the same order as in   A  –  C  . Results are overlaid on each volunteer's   T   volume and are masked to only include effects within the highlighted right STS region (  P   < 0.001, uncorrected). It can be seen that even in the absence of eye movement effects, anterior STS/STG codes head turn direction. (  G  –  I  ) Results as in   D  –  F   but masked to show effects within a 20 mm radius of the peak early visual head turn classification effect from the main study. It can be seen that the effects in early visual cortex also remain when eye movements are controlled. 
  

### Follow-up fMRI Experiment with Revised Design 
  
We tested whether our main classification findings in STS/STG and early visual cortex survived in the absence of eye movements by carrying out a second fMRI experiment with the revised experimental paradigm. We recruited the 4 volunteers who showed no significant eye movement effects in the eye tracking test outside the scanner. Volunteers completed a full 6-set version of the revised experiment (1080 trials, for details, see Material and Methods), while their eye position was monitored. One of the 4 scanned volunteers showed a significant fixation shift in response to the head turns whilst being scanned (  t   = 8.72,   P   = 0.003). This volunteer was removed from further analysis. 

Although the 3 remaining volunteers showed no significant eye movement effects (as observed in separate tests before and during scanning), left–right classification of head turns in the right anterior STS region was greater than chance in 2 volunteers (  P   < 0.05, Bonferroni FWE corrected for the right STS mask) and at reduced thresholds in the third (  P   < 0.001, uncorrected,  ). The final volunteer also showed an effect in posterior STS (  P   < 0.05, FWE). 

All 3 volunteers showed significant left–right head turn classification effects in early visual cortex (  P   < 0.05 Bonferroni FWE corrected for a 20 mm radius sphere centered on the peak head turn classification effect in the main experiment,  ). However, unlike the main experiment, where this effect was joined by univariate response preferences for head turns in a direction ipsilateral to the visual hemifield (  Supplementary Fig. 4  A   ), we now observed preferentially contralateral responses to head turn direction (  P   < 0.001, uncorrected,   Supplementary Fig. 4  B   ). Thus, although the classification effects in early visual cortex were accompanied by univariate effects also in the revised experiment, laterality of these univariate effects was reversed. 



## Discussion 
  
Appropriate social behavior is dependent on accurately inferring where others are attending. In the visual domain, this inferential process is likely to involve direction-sensitive coding of social attention cues, such as head turns. In experiments, these stimuli are often abstracted to static views, which fails to capture their dynamic character in natural social interaction. Here, we demonstrate that response patterns in human right anterior STS/STG distinguish between leftward and rightward dynamic head turns. Furthermore, left–right head turns were significantly more discriminable in this region than left–right ellipsoid control stimuli. A similar analysis of the left STS region revealed no left–right classification of head turn direction at any site in the ROI. 

The peak coordinates for left–right classification of head turn direction in the current study are in close proximity to a previous demonstration of direction-sensitive fMRI adaptation to static gaze ( ; 16 mm distance between peaks). Considered collectively, these results suggest a general role for right anterior STS/STG in supplying higher order social cognitive processes with important information about the direction of another's attentional shifts, whether these are conveyed by static gaze in a front-facing head or dynamic head turns. Consistent with this social role, we also demonstrate that direction sensitivity does not extend to nonsocial control stimulus motion in this region. An important question is whether such direction-sensitive responses to dynamic and static social cues are driven by a single representation of the direction of another's social attention ( ) or whether dynamic information is coded separately, as indicated by the finding that STS neurons tuned to head turn motion do not respond to static head view displays ( ;  ). 

Neurons in macaque anterior STS are tuned to the direction of social attention cues ( ;  ). However, most human fMRI studies have reported gaze or head turn effects in posterior rather than anterior STS regions ( ). Our classification effects appear more consistent with the typical recording site in macaque anterior STS than with previous univariate fMRI effects in human posterior STS. Compared with standard univariate analysis, MVPA and fMRI adaptation techniques confer greater sensitivity ( ). This increased sensitivity makes more rigorous comparisons possible, for instance between left and right averted social attention cues. Accordingly, we also observed greater consistency between human fMRI and single unit evidence from the macaque (see also  ,  ;  ). Known human–macaque discrepancies in the function of posterior STS and surrounding areas suggest that a simple correspondence between human and macaque may not apply to all high-level visual areas ( ), but such a simple correspondence nevertheless offers a useful working model for the representation of social attention cues. 

The pattern of results we observed in posterior and anterior portions of the right STS region also highlights how large-scale univariate response level differences can dissociate from multivariate classification performance ( ;  ;  ). Similar to previous studies ( ), we found that right posterior STS responded more to heads than to ellipsoids, while no such preferential responding was observed in anterior STS/STG. The left–right head turn classification effects showed the opposite pattern, with significant effects in anterior but not posterior regions. There are clear parallels between this pattern of effects and a recent report where face identity classification was possible in an anterior inferotemporal region, which did not respond preferentially to faces over places, while no such face identity effects appeared in the more posterior fusiform face area, even though this region responded more to faces than to places ( ). Face identity and head turn direction are both important dimensions for face processing, yet multivariate sensitivity for manipulations along these dimensions does not appear to colocalize with univariate selectivity for faces over other object categories. Although more systematic studies of these within- and between-category dissociations are needed before their theoretical implications for face perception can be fully considered, the current results indicate that studies where data analysis is restricted to functional ROIs defined by face selectivity are at risk of missing potentially important effects ( ;  ). 

Neurons with social attention responses in macaque STS are often invariant to the identity of the individual conveying the cue ( ). In this study, we observed no generalization between response patterns evoked by left–right head turns across the 2 identities. Although there is some initial evidence to suggest that STS neurons can code both head view and head identity ( ), it is in our view unlikely that the representation across STS is identity-specific. For instance, it has previously been shown that direct and averted static head views can be distinguished across identity in posterior STS ( ). Given that separate training of left–right classification for each identity involves half as much data as compared with when this dimension is collapsed, it is more likely that our experiment was not sufficiently sensitive to detect any such identity-invariant head turn representations. 

Our results suggest that the anterior STS region distinguishes the direction of perceived head turns. The follow-up eye-tracking experiment suggested that volunteers' eye movements tended to follow the direction of head turns, thus presenting a potential confound to the interpretation of our results. To rule out an eye movement account of our reported classification effects, we demonstrated in a revised fMRI experiment that a subset of volunteers from the main experiment showed significant left–right head turn classification in the right STS region, even though these volunteers showed no significant eye movement effects during pretests or whilst in the scanner. Thus, even though our main analysis is potentially limited by an eye movement confound, the head turn direction codes in the right anterior STS region remain when this confound is removed. The absence of prior reports of eye movement responses in the anterior STS region is also consistent with this interpretation ( ;  ). By contrast, even minute eye movements elicit responses in early visual cortex ( ), and an eye movement account would seem to account well for the pattern of ipsilateral univariate selectivity we observed in the main experiment, with leftward and rightward head turns producing responses in left and right early visual cortex, respectively. Notably, this ipsilateral pattern of effects reverted to the expected contralateral response preference in the univariate analysis of the follow-up experiment, even though left–right head turn classification in early visual cortex was significant in both the original and the follow-up experiments. These results suggest that the classification effects in the 2 data sets were driven by distinct large-scale univariate effects: a primarily eye movement-related response in the main experiment and a visually-evoked response in the follow-up experiment. 

The pervasive tendency for volunteers to follow social attention cues points to an intriguingly close link between action and perception in this system, which is worthy of further enquiry. Previous investigators found that static gaze cues also evoke small eye movements in the perceived gaze direction ( ). Indeed, 2 of the 5 volunteers who were tested with eye tracking in the current study were unable to consistently suppress eye movements in response to the head turns, even in the presence of a fixation cross and strong instructions to maintain fixation. Although interesting in their own right, these eye movement effects also suggest that investigators who seek to isolate effects of perceived gaze direction would be well advised to monitor the volunteer's own gaze. 

Previous studies have found that socially relevant motion engages MT ( ;  ). Consistent with this literature, we observed a univariate response preference for heads relative to ellipsoids in bilateral superior temporal regions likely corresponding to MT+. Despite this category preference for heads relative to ellipsoids, we obtained no evidence that response patterns in this region distinguish head turn direction. In previous studies that attempted to decode motion directions, direction sensitivity was weaker in MT than in earlier visual areas ( ;  ), which the authors attribute to MT's smaller anatomical size compared with earlier visual areas. Although neurophysiological data suggest considerable direction sensitivity in both MT and early visual cortex ( ), such response properties may interact with area size when measured with coarse-grained methods such as fMRI, thus producing apparently weaker or nonsignificant effects in smaller areas ( ). Note also that both the absence of a functional MT localizer and the use of weaker, more transient motion stimuli may have rendered our analysis less sensitive to direction-sensitive responses in MT+, compared with previous studies ( ;  ). Thus, we do not exclude the possibility that head turns produce direction-sensitive MT+ responses, although we were unable to find evidence for this. 

In conclusion, we have presented evidence that response patterns in human right anterior STS/STG distinguish between leftward and rightward dynamic head turns. Such direction sensitivity was not detected for physically matched ellipsoid control stimuli. The anterior site of this effect is consistent with evidence from macaque neurophysiology ( ;  ) but does not colocalize with regions showing greater univariate responses to heads than to ellipsoids. In this respect, multivariate pattern approaches show great promise in linking evidence from single neurons in the macaque to large-scale response patterns in human fMRI.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Imitation and observation of actions and facial emotional expressions activates the human fronto-parietal mirror network. There is skepticism regarding the role of this low-level network in more complex high-level social behaviour. We sought to test whether neural activation during an observation/imitation task was related to both lower and higher level social cognition. We employed an established observe/imitate task of emotional faces during functional MRI in 28 healthy adults, with final analyses based on 20 individuals following extensive quality control. Partial least squares (PLS) identified patterns of relationships between spatial activation and a battery of objective out-of-scanner assessments that index lower and higher-level social cognitive performance, including the Penn emotion recognition task, reading the mind in the eyes, the awareness of social inference test (TASIT) parts 1, 2, and 3, and the relationships across domains (RAD) test. Strikingly, activity in limbic, right inferior frontal, and inferior parietal areas during imitation of emotional faces correlated with performance on emotion evaluation (TASIT1), social inference - minimal (TASIT2), social inference - enriched (TASIT3), and the RAD tests. These results show a role for this network in both lower-level and higher-level social cognitive processes which are collectively critical for social functioning in everyday life.

## Introduction 
  
Social interactions are complex processes which are built upon the perception and understanding of the actions, intentions, and mental state of others. Social cognitive neuroscience has suggested a dichotomy between low-level processes such as understanding motor actions or emotional processing and higher-level processes such as inferring the mental states of others (e.g. theory of mind) or detecting deception and sarcasm. This apparent dichotomy between lower level and higher level social cognitive processes is supported by behavioral , neuroimaging  and lesion studies . Neuroimaging studies have primarily examined these processes with two approaches: using tasks relevant to the perception of and interaction with other people’s actions (action observation and imitation), and using tasks relevant to infer the beliefs and desires of the other person (mentalizing). Lower level social cognitive processes such as action interpretation have been associated with activation of a lateral frontal-parietal network, the putative human analogue to the mirror neuron system observed in monkeys . Higher-level social cognitive processes, such as theory of mind, have been associated with activation of cortical midline regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus, as well as temporoparietal junction and temporal pole. This network is also known as the ‘mentalizing’ system. Dual processing models have been proposed in which the lateral fronto-parietal network supports relatively automatic processes such as identifying motor actions while the mentalizing network supports controlled processes of attributing actions to complex social causes . 

Most neuroimaging studies examining the lateral fronto-parietal network have made use of hand actions or other forms of simple motor stimuli . As such, the role of this system has been mainly considered in the context of perceiving gross motor actions. Some have taken the concept of mirroring one step further, by arguing that the lateral fronto-parietal network is important for emotional empathy by permitting humans to feel what others feel, and potentially to assess or interpret emotional cues and social behaviour . Investigating this issue may be best served by paradigms utilizing socially relevant stimuli as opposed to simple motor acts. One such paradigm is the imitation and observation of emotional faces, which has been shown to activate the lateral fronto-parietal ‘mirror’ network . This is consistent with the notion that activation of this network can play a role in allowing people to empathize by imitating emotions . Activity in the right IFG has been positively correlated with self-report measures of empathy in healthy children , and has been shown to be more active in normally developing children than those with autism , with activity in autistic children inversely correlated with social impairment. However, the IFG has also been implicated in some higher level social cognitive processes, specifically the inhibiting self-perspective in social judgements . Recent work has also shown structural changes in right fronto-parietal cortex in more socially impaired people with schizophrenia , a group of individuals in whom higher-level social cognitive processes such as theory of mind are more prominently affected . These findings raise the question of whether neural activation during basic mirroring tasks is related to higher-level social cognitive abilities. 

Meta-analysis of fMRI data has shown little overlap between activity in the brain regions associated with the mirroring and mentalizing systems across a range of tasks , and brain lesion studies have suggested a dissociation between mirroring and mentalizing regions . As such, mirroring and mentalizing were initially thought to represent dichotomous systems which function relatively independently, and the role of mirroring in higher-level social cognition is a contentious issue . However, there is a growing body of evidence that the mentalizing and mirroring systems may interact during more complex social cognitive processing, such as watching social videos . Co-activation of mentalizing and mirroring regions has also been noted when viewing agents performing irrational actions, suggesting aspects of the mentalizing system may facilitate interpreting unexpected actions . The mirroring and mentalizing system may work together during social cognitive processing, although a specific role of the mirror system in higher-level cognitive processing has yet to be established. 

The purpose of this study is to determine whether brain regions activated during a facial emotion mirroring task are related to lower-level social cognitive performance, higher-level social cognitive performance, or both. We utilized a process specific social mirroring task (the facial imitate/observe task ) inside the fMRI, along with a battery of objective out-of-scanner social tests ranging from basic emotional-perception tasks to complex higher level social cognitive tasks such as detection of lies or sarcasm. Brain-behavior relationships were examined using the spatio-temporal partial least squares (PLS), a non-parametric multivariate approach . PLS identifies latent variables (LVs), linear combinations of fMRI signal amplitude at each voxel across time and a design matrix which can consist of either experimental conditions or correlations across conditions with behavioral scores. Each LV expresses a pattern of the common covariance between the design and the fMRI data. PLS is designed to handle data with high collinearity while simultaneously capturing essential non-redundant relationships among the data , overcoming the confounding influence of collinear variables in traditional multiple regression . This makes PLS an excellent approach to uncover relationships between brain activity and a set of social cognitive scores which are likely highly interrelated. We hypothesized that a) consistent with previous studies, imitating emotional faces would activate the mirroring network, more prominently in the imitate than the observe condition, and b) neural activity during imitation of emotional faces specifically (rather than imitating neutral faces or observing faces) would be associated with both lower-level and higher-level social cognitive performance. 


## Results 
  
### Task Effects 
  
Task PLS is a multivariate model-free approach to identify spatial patterns which share relationships across the experimental conditions. A task PLS was run on the data to replicate previous task-based analysis, and examine the underlying pattern of task task-evoked spatial activity. PLS generated 6 LVs (as there were three trial types, emotional faces, neutral faces, and fixation, and two conditions, Imitate and Observe). Permutation analysis (see methods below) showed significance (p < 0.05) in the first three LVs, which accounted for 61.6%, and 14.5%, and 12.9% of crossblock covariance respectively (Fig.  ). LV 1 was related to viewing faces as opposed to fixation trials, and showed a pattern related to the lateral frontal-parietal network similar to the results of previous studies . LV 1 was related to viewing faces in general rather than distinguishing between emotional and neutral faces, demonstrating that this pattern of faces >fixation in the mirroring network is the dominant pattern of neural activity within this task analysis. LVs 2 and 3 explain some of the remaining variance in the data not accounted for the pattern presented in LV 1, representing interaction effects showing different patterns of activity across the Imitate and Observe conditions. LV 2 shows a large amount of overlap with LV 1, suggesting some of the variance within those regions is explained by aspects of both LVs 1 and 2. The majority of the variance explained by LV 1, but some additional variance within those voxels is explained by the pattern of emotional faces >neutral and fixation in Imitate and increased activity in fixation trials for Observe, as seen in LV 2. LV 3 represents an interaction in which the relative effects of neutral faces and fixation are different in the Imitate and Observe tasks.   
Results from the first latent variable using task PLS analysis. Data is shown for LV1, 2 and 3. The top panel shows the design pattern (the contribution of each condition to the LV). Error bars are 95% confidence interval derived from the bootstrap analysis. The bottom panel shows the voxel pattern from the first lag of the PLS analysis rendered on the cortex. Sagittal slices are shown for X = −10 (left) and X = 10 (right). Voxel intensity is displayed as bootstrap ratio, a measure of reliability of voxels within the LV. Red-yellow regions show the pattern described by the design pattern, while blue regions show the opposite pattern. 
  

For consistency and replication of previous studies, we also ran a general linear model (GLM) in SPM8. The GLM showed a similar pattern as in previous studies and LV1 of the task PLS (see supplementary methods and Supplementary Figure 1). 


### Behavioral PLS 
  
Behavioral PLS examined the relationships between patterns of activity in the brain and social cognitive test scores. Scores from six social cognitive tasks were included: the Emotion Recognition (ER40) , the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, RMET , the Relationships Across Domains test (RAD) , and the three subtests of the Awareness of Social Inference Test Revised (TASIT-R) . TASIT1 can be considered a test of lower-level social cognitive functioning, while TASIT2 and TASIT3 are high-level tests. The behavioral PLS generated 36 LVs, as there were six experimental conditions (emotional faces, neutral faces, and fixation, separately for Imitate and Observe, and six social cognitive tests). Overall permutation analysis showed significance in the first two LVs, which accounted for 23% and 13.2% of crossblock covariance respectively. However, the split-half permutation reliability analysis (see methods) demonstrated that the relationship between the design pattern and brain pattern was not reliable within LV 1 and as such it was not considered further. In LV 2, neural activity during imitation of emotional faces was positively correlated with RAD, TASIT1, TASIT2, and TASIT3 (Fig.  , top panel). Neural activity for Fixation and Neutral faces during Imitate, as well as Neutral faces during Observe, was negatively correlated with those same test scores. As such, LV 2 shows a pattern of correlations during the imitation of emotional faces related to performance on TASIT1, TASIT2, TASIT3, and RAD.

Each lag represents a time point (TR) following stimuli onset (which occurred during ‘Lag0’). 
  

The pattern of brain activity in LV 2 (Fig.  , bottom panel) when imitating emotional faces in lag 1 showed a positive relationship with performance on TASIT1 TASIT2, TASIT3, and RAD. Activity was present in right pars opercularis (within inferior frontal gyrus), right and left supramarginal gyrus, right motor cortex, bilateral anterior temporal regions, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal cortex. Activity was also noted in right anterior/mid cingulate, right rolandic operculum, right putamen, and the cerebellum. Activity in lags 4 and 5, which positively correlated with social cognitive performance, was notably present in anterior temporal regions as well as in posterior middle and inferior right temporal gyri. Several regions showed negative relationships to the design pattern (thus greater fMRI activity while imitating emotional faces in individuals with poorer social cognitive performance), including the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars operculum and pars triangularis), and bilaterally in the basal ganglia (greatest in left putamen and right globus pallidus). 



## Discussion 
  
The behavioral PLS results of this study showed a robust relationship between neural activity during a process-specific imitate-observe task and both lower-level and higher-level social cognitive performance. While a growing number of studies using complex stimuli have noted co-activation of mirroring and mentalizing regions , co-activity cannot be taken to conclude that mirroring has a strong role in higher level social cognition. The novelty of our study is that we showed complex relationships of neural activity during a simple and process-specific mirroring task with performance on objective out-of-scanner assessments of higher-level social cognitive performance. In addition, the PLS approach allowed us to include several assessments in a single analysis, providing data driven evidence of which assessments best capture these brain-behaviour relationships. These behavioral relationships were specific to imitation of emotional faces, rather than neutral faces. Several regions outside the right fronto-parietal circuit, including left IFG and some mentalizing regions (e.g. TPJ), also showed negative correlations with social cognitive performance, suggesting either compensatory responses or over-activation in participants with poorer social cognition. 

These findings of a relationship between activity in a simple mirroring task and higher level social cognitive processing scores suggest a relationship for the mirror network in higher-order social cognitive processing including complex tasks. Effective mentalizing in humans although likely primarily reliant on classic mentalizing regions may be further subserved by mirroring regions . Given that the relationships elicited were noted in assessments involving interpretation of dynamic interactive video tasks including human actors, it may be that such relationships are only evoked when we consider social cognition as a process involving integrating information from multiple processing levels. The mirroring network may not be solely for understanding the intentions and physical goals of motor acts . Our findings add to the debate regarding the role of this network in social cognition . Several authors have argued that this network is important not only for imitation or action perception, but also for emotional empathy and possibly even in cognitive empathy (sometimes used interchangeably with theory of mind) , consistent with the theory of embodied simulation , despite debate to the contrary . Through the combination of a process-specific in-scanner task, more naturalistic and objective social cognitive tests, and the PLS multivariate framework, we were able to uncover essential brain-behavior relationships for which traditional task contrasts or linear regression analyses may be less sensitive. 

Higher level social cognitive processing involves concepts related to both theory of mind and cognitive empathy, both complex constructs which likely encompass several mental processes. To date, there is only limited evidence of overlap in neural activity between high-level tasks related to the mentalizing network and low-level tasks related to the mirroring network . However, task based analysis is often performed by contrasting conditions, and many mirroring tasks have utilized stimuli with little or no direct social relevance, or tasks designed to evaluate highly specific social cognitive processes which may not be well suited to capturing overlap within these systems . By moving away from an ‘overlapping activity’ perspective into an approach focused on brain-behavior relationships, we were able to demonstrate that activity in the mirroring network is correlated with higher-level social cognitive abilities. This combination of pairing a process-specific task paradigm with dynamic social cognitive measures may be a powerful approach for probing relationships between social cognitive networks and real-life social cognitive abilities. 

The behavioral PLS LV correlating neural activation during imitation of emotional faces with TASIT and RAD scores also included some regions which are often considered part of the mentalizing network. While these regions did not robustly activate during the task PLS, their presence in the behavioural PLS reflects activation during the imitate task that is relevant for social cognitive performance. Positive relationships with social cognition and emotional faces were observed in the temporal pole bilaterally, a region implicated in mentalizing and theory of mind  as well as in processing deception . Activity was also noted in the posterior region of the superior temporal sulcus, which may be of particular interest as this area has been implicated in both the mirroring/imitation network  and the mentalizing network . The superior temporal sulcus may serve as an integrative region, sharing information between these two networks  and/or as serving as a relay point for high level visual information . The superior temporal sulcus has also been implicated in analyzing dynamic facial features , perceiving biological motion , and gaze perception . As such, this region is involved with perceptual processes necessary for both low-level and high-level social cognition. It remains to be seen if this region may serve as an integrative hub between the mentalizing and mirroring networks, though the posterior superior temporal sulcus shares connectivity within both networks  and has been implicated as an important region in social cognitive impairment in autism . 

Studies showing increased connectivity between the right IFG (a critical hub of the mirroring network) and the mentalizing network provide evidence for functional communications between these networks . This connectivity between mirroring and mentalizing regions has been shown to be disrupted in autism , raising the possibility that disrupted social cognition in autism may be driven not only by localized effects within one of these systems but also as a network level disruption in how these systems interact. Likewise, social cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia, strongly related to overall functional outcomes . People with schizophrenia have been noted to show reduced right IFG activity when imitating emotional faces as well as opposite relationships between self-reported empathy and right IFG activity compared to controls . As social cognitive impairment is present at, or potentially preceding the onset of psychosis , it is possible this relatively brief imitate/observe in-scanner task may be useful as a potential early risk marker of the disease. 

We found that increased activity in the left IFG was associated with poorer social cognitive performance, as well as in clusters in the left medial frontal cortex and the TPJ . One study examining resting state network connectivity noted over-connectivity of the left IFG in the mirroring network in participants with autism, consistent with our finding that over activity in the left IFG is associated with poorer social cognitive performance . A number of regions outside the mirroring or mentalizing networks also showed a negative relationship with social cognitive performance, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, occipital cortex and superior colliculus. These regions may be involved in emotional face processing . We propose three possible explanations for the negative correlations between this pattern of neural activity when imitating emotional faces and social cognitive performance: 1) prolonged neural activity related to less efficient processing resulting in a greater magnitude of hemodynamic signal, as may be suggested by increased activity in regions associated with visual and face processing; 2) compensatory activity in which individuals with less efficient processing make greater use of the left IFG to compensate for lack of activity on the right (the compensatory hypothesis); or 3) over activity in the left IFG resulting in competition with right IFG, resulting in interference or an decrease in network coherence and deficits in social cognitive test performance (the dedifferentiation hypothesis). One possible explanation is that participants with poor performance may be attempting to compensate by activating aspects of the mentalizing system during lower-level social cognitive processing. It has been suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex, a region noted in the behavioral PLS, is involved in biasing activity towards either mentalizing or simulation . 

We did not find reliable relationships between the ER40 and RMET with neural activity to emotional faces. The ER40 and RMET rely on static images which fail to capture the full complexity of social cognitive processing, unlike the TASIT which requires interpretation of video scenarios of complex human interactions and the RAD which involves interpreting stories. It may be that more complex and process-general tests are required to more fully elicit relationships between activity in the simulation and mentalizing networks . Supporting this assertion, correlations between TASIT test scores and the observed voxel pattern in the PLS analysis were as high as 0.8, indicating a very strong relationship between mirroring network activity and social cognitive performance measured by TASIT1 (a lower-level task), as well as higher-level tasks TASIT2, and TASIT3. Some recent studies using more naturalistic higher-level social-cognitive paradigms, such as videos, have implicated IFG activity , and a small number of recent studies involving more complex social interaction tasks have noted co-activation in mirroring and mentalizing regions . 

Here we provide evidence that neural activation while imitating emotional faces is related to performance on dynamic and objective ‘real-life’ assessments of even the most complex social cognitive tasks. Given the relatively small sample size, further research expanding into a larger sample would be worthwhile to replicate and extend these findings. However, our findings suggest that patterns of neural activation during basic imitative behaviour may be a surrogate marker for highly complex social function in humans. The paradigm demonstrated here may be particularly useful for early identification studies in neurologic and psychiatric disorders with social cognitive impairment, and in intervention studies using ‘target engagement’ as a marker of early treatment response. 


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Twenty-eight healthy adult participants were initially included in this study. Average age of participants was 34.3 ± 11.7 years, with 18 men and 10 women, 23 right-handed participants, and an average level of education of 15.1 ± 2.22 years. Participants aged 18 to 55 were included in the study. All participants completed the Edinburgh handedness Inventory and were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders (SCID) to rule out possible psychiatric illness. Urine toxicology screening was performed to further ensure that no participant with a current substance use disorder was included in the study. Additionally, exclusion criteria included a first degree relative with a history of psychotic mental disorder, a history of head trauma resulting in unconsciousness, or a history of seizure or other neurological disorders. The protocol was approved by the research ethics board of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto, all research was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the tri-council policy statement on Ethic Conduct for Research Involving Humans. All participants gave informed consent, and signed an institutionally approved informed consent form, prior to any research procedures. 


### Social Cognitive Assessments 
  
The Emotion Recognition (ER40) task consists of 40 images of whole faces making emotional expressions, with participants selecting from four possible emotional responses . The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET)  consists of 36 trials showing only the eyes of a black and white face, with four possible choices to describe what the person is feeling (e.g. amused, irritated, cautious, contemplative). The RMET is considered a test of empathic abilities as it measures the ability to judge emotional states from looking at the eyes. The Relationships Across Domains (RAD) test  presents 25 written vignettes of 2–4 lines followed by three statements which describe the behaviour of the male-female dyad from each vignette in domains of social life different from that vignette. Participants indicate if the behavior described in each statement is likely or unlikely to occur based on what was learned from the vignettes. The Awareness of Social Inference Test, Revised (TASIT) uses short video vignettes to measure emotional perception and theory of mind . The TASIT is divided into three parts. Part 1 (TASIT1) consists of 24 short videos of actors portraying different emotional states (happy, sad, fear, disgust, surprise, and anger). Part 2 (TASIT2; social inference – minimal) consists of 15 videos showing sincere or sarcastic interactions between two actors, followed by four questions relating to what the actors were thinking, doing, meaning to say, and feeling. TASIT2 is considered a test of theory of mind. TASIT part 3 (TASIT3; social inference – enriched) consists of 15 vignettes in which the speaker is making an assertion which is literally untrue, but can represent either sarcasm or an attempt at deception. Success in TASIT3 requires the ability to detect deception in social encounters. In total, six social cognitive scores were derived from these tests (ER40 reaction time, RMET, RAD TASIT1, TASIT2, and TASIT3). Age was regressed out of all social cognitive test scores. 


### MRI Scanning 
  
MRI scanning was conducted on a Discovery 3 T MR750 machine from General Electric at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. The Imitate/Observe task was part of a longer multimodal MRI protocol to which each participant consented. Each block of the task (Imitate and Observe) was collected in counter-balanced order as a separate echo-planar imaging scan, with TRs = 3 sec, TE 30 ms, voxel size 3 mm isotropic, 50 slices, 64 × 64 matrix with FOV = 192 mm, flip angle = 77, and 110 TRs per scan. The first 5 TRs were excluded prior to any preprocessing to allow for magnetic steady-state. 


### Imitate/Observe Task 
  
The participants performed an imitate/observe task as previously described  while being scanned. Participants were shown full-color photographs from an ethnically diverse set of 16 individuals (eight males and eight females) expressing five different facial expressions (fearful, sad, happy, angry, or neutral). During one scanning session, participants were instructed to imitate the expression on the faces (the   Imitate   session), while in the other session participants were instructed to observe the face (the   Observe   session). Each run consisted of 80 faces (16 per facial expression) plus 16 fixation trials presented in a pseudorandomized order determined using Optimize Design 11  to maximize contrast efficiency. Each trial lasted three seconds, with the faces presented for two seconds and a jittered ISI (500 ms to 1500 ms). The order of sessions (Imitate or Observe) was counter-balanced across participants. Participants practiced the task prior to MRI scanning and were instructed to minimize motion during the imitation, only using their facial muscles when matching the expressions. A video recording during the scan confirmed that all participants were following instructions (i.e. imitating during the imitate session but not during observe). 


### fMRI data analysis - Preprocessing 
  
The initial preprocessing stages were slice time corrected and motion corrected in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Individual sessions were subjected to single-session independent components analysis (ICA, from the MELODIC module in FSL 5.0.6). ICA reports were visually examined, and any ICAs which were clear artifacts were removed based on a set of established criteria. On a case by case basis where some large motions contaminated the ICAs, data ‘scrubbing’ was performed using a spline interpolation. Generally, two TRs were removed for each motion spike, and no more than three TRs were permitted per motion spike and a maximum of three motion spikes were removed from any scan. Of the 56 sessions (Observe and Imitate for the 28 participants) scrubbing was performed in 16 sessions. In nine of these cases (four Observe sessions and five Imitate sessions) scrubbing was not successful. Possible reasons for unsuccessful ‘data scrubbing’ include large movements exceeding three TRs, more than three large movements, or over 90% of ICA components classified as artifact after data scrubbing. These sessions were subsequently excluded from further analysis, leaving neuroimaging data from 20 of the original 28 individuals for final analysis. Data were then de-noised based on the selected noise ICA components using FSL 5.0.6 (reg_filt). Normalization into MNI space was done using SPM8, and images were smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. 


### Partial Least Squares Analysis 
  
Patterns of task related activity and relationships between social cognitive test scores and BOLD signal were examined using spatio-temporal PLS , a multivariate approach which allows for detection of spatial patterns and dependant variables across the brain without the need for a-priori selected contrasts across experimental conditions. PLS is designed to handle data with high collinearity while capturing essential non-redundant relationships among the data , overcoming the confounding influence of collinear variables (e.g. cognitive tests) in traditional multiple regression. Additionally, PLS is also well suited to studying the relationships between numerous variables even in the presence of a relatively small sample, which is ideal for our purposes as it allows us to examine a range of social cognitive batteries. PLS produces latent variables (  LVs  ) relating patterns of experiment task activity or behavioral measures with spatial patterns of neural activity across time points (scans, referred to as    lags   , normalized to the scan in which the stimuli was presented, labeled as lag0). As a model free non-parametric approach, PLS is ideal to examine complex relationships amongst the battery of social cognitive scores and neural activity when imitating and observing emotional faces. 

A task-PLS analysis was conducted to replicate the regions of activity in the SPM8 GLM. Brain data from an 18 second window (corresponding to 6 lags) was normalized to the first lag (lag0) to create a data matrix for each condition, stacked across participants. Cross covariance was calculated between the data matrix and a design matrix consisting of vector of experimental conditions (in the task PLS, emotional faces, neutral faces, and fixation crosses, separately for Imitate and Observe). The resulting cross-covariance matrix was then decomposed using singular value decomposition, which created a set of orthogonal latent variables (  LVs  ) which optimally represent spatio-temporal relationships between voxels and experimental conditions. For each LV, a pattern of voxels at each lag value (the ‘brain pattern’) demonstrates the relationship with activity in the voxel at that lag and the ‘design pattern’ (representing the weights of each experimental event). Voxel weight is expressed as salience, which is proportional to the covariance of activity in that voxel and the design pattern expressed by that LV. 

Behavioral PLS was used to examine relationships between social cognition and neural activity. Behavioral PLS examines patterns of covariance between scores and neural activity for each trial type across lags. As such the design pattern is the correlation between the overall pattern of neural activity in each condition and each social cognitive score. For the behavioral PLS, neural activity to emotional faces, neutral faces, and fixation (separately for imitate and observe) was related to the six social cognitive test scores from our battery, deterministically producing 36 LVs. 

Statistical evaluation of each LV was performed using split-half permutation testing. A total of 500 permutations were run, with 100 split-half permutations within each. The overall permutation score determines if the effect represented by the LV is sufficiently strong to be differentiated from random noise, while the split-half analysis provides a measure of the stability of relationships between voxel patterns and design patterns in the data for each latent variable. As the permutations are performed at the level of the entire PLS analysis (rather than on individual LVs), multiple comparisons for the number of LVs is not necessary. In the split-half, the ‘BrainCorr’ value tests the reliability of the voxel pattern for a given design pattern associated with an LV, while ‘DesignCorr’ tests the reliability of a given voxel pattern for the behavioral pattern associated with that LV. Results are expressed as p-values. LV’s were considered significant if the overall permutation and at least one of the BrainCorr or DesignCorr was less than 0.05. A bootstrapping procedure with 1000 iterations was used to test if specific voxels were reliably related to the LV. A bootstrap ratio for each voxel was calculated as the voxel salience divided by its bootstrap standard error. A bootstrap ratio of 2.5 (corresponding to >95% reliability) was used to threshold all voxel pattern maps in PLS.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social cognition in healthy adults (N=34; mean age 22.2), using a naturalistic movie-viewing task that probes perception and understanding of others. The authors report group-level analyses including whole-brain voxelwise reverse-correlation maps and statistical parametric maps (χ2 and corrected thresholds) identifying regions (DMPFC, TPJ, temporal poles) responsive to social interactions. Thus: (1) task is social-related (mentalizing/social interaction); (2) sample is healthy adults within age range; (3) whole-brain, group-level task-evoked voxelwise results are reported and described. No exclusion criteria are met (not ROI-only, not resting-state, not clinical-only). Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI task study of social-related processing (perception of fearful faces) including a healthy adult control group (N=13; mean age 25.6, within 17–65). The paper reports group-level, voxelwise task-evoked contrasts for the control group (e.g., main effect of faces vs scrambled baseline and linear contrasts of fear intensity) with coordinates and figures, using a random-effects GLM and whole-brain thresholding (p<0.001 uncorrected) and reporting activations (with small-volume corrections for a priori ROIs). Results for the healthy/control group are presented separately from the clinical (HFA/AS) group. Although ROI/SVC procedures were applied to hypothesized social-brain regions, the study provides univariate, whole-brain task activation maps/coordinates for the healthy adults, satisfying inclusion criteria.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study uses task-based fMRI with a social attribution/Theory of Mind paradigm (People vs Bumper contrast). It includes a healthy adult control group (CON; n=17, ages 18–39) with results reported separately. The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task contrasts and maps for the control group (one-sample t-tests and group maps for CON shown in Fig. 3; peak coordinates and cluster tables provided in Tables 2–4 and whole-brain two-sample contrasts in Table 3). The analyses are not limited to ROI-only or connectivity/resting-state approaches. Thus all inclusion criteria are met (social-related fMRI task, healthy adult group, and whole-brain, task-evoked group results). No exclusion criteria are violated.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This study uses task-based fMRI to assess a social cognition construct (theory of mind) in healthy younger and older adult groups and additionally reports intrinsic (resting-state) connectivity within a task-defined theory-of-mind network. The paper explicitly states that a task-defined network was identified (implying group-level task activation maps) and links task behavior to neural connectivity. Younger adults are included (presumably within the 17–65 range) and results for healthy groups are reported separately. The study is empirical and reports original fMRI data. Although the excerpt does not list exact ages or present the tables/figures of whole-brain activation maps, the description indicates within-group task-defined whole-brain results were used to define the network; thus it meets the inclusion criteria for an fMRI social-task study with whole-brain, healthy-group task effects.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This fMRI study used a well-established social task (Cyberball social exclusion). It included a healthy adult control group (HC; n=28 female adults) and reports whole-brain, voxelwise within-group results for the healthy controls (main effect of condition in left anterior insula; voxelwise FWE-corrected p<0.05, k≥10). The task probes social-related processing (social exclusion/belonging), and results for the healthy group are clearly described and generalizable to healthy adults. Although ages are not explicitly listed in the excerpt, participants are described as adult females and recruitment/ethical procedures imply an adult sample. Therefore it meets the meta-analysis inclusion criteria (social-related fMRI task, healthy adult group, whole-brain healthy-group task activation reported).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
Suicidal behaviors result from a complex interaction between social stressors and individual vulnerability. However, little is known of the specific neural network supporting the sensitivity to social stressors in patients at risk of suicidal acts. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we investigated brain processing of social rejection in suicide attempters. Thirty-six euthymic women with a history of depression and suicidal behavior were compared to 41 euthymic women with a history of depression but no suicidal attempt, and 28 healthy controls. The Cyberball Game was used as a validated social exclusion paradigm. Relative to healthy controls, both patient groups reported higher levels of social distress related to the task, without significant differences according to suicidal status. Compared to patients without any history of suicide attempt and healthy controls, suicide attempters showed decreased contrast in the left insula and supramarginal gyrus during the exclusion vs. inclusion condition, after controlling for number of depressive episodes, medication, mood disorder type or social phobia. Our study highlights impaired brain response to social exclusion in euthymic female suicide attempters in regions previously implicated in pain tolerance and social cognition.

## Introduction 
  
Humans have a fundamental need for social belonging that, when thwarted, has consequences on mental well-being . Low social integration has been reported as a potential risk factor for suicide , raising the question of the need to focus on an “outside- in” view to capture the dynamic influence between biological and environmental factors on suicidal behavior . The majority of suicide victims had experienced at least one or more adverse life events within the last few months before their death . Interpersonal conflicts, relationship breakdown and job loss or difficulties are among the most prevalent events, all social stressors confronting the individual with some form of social exclusion and a threat toward their social status. However, while these events are rather common in general, only the most vulnerable individuals are at increased risk of committing suicide when facing such stressors, suggesting that the way these individuals process social perception and interactions is key to understanding their fatal act. It has been suggested that all these psychosocial stressors trigger a high level of psychological pain, a frequent theme in suicide notes , which, in turn, increases the risk of suicidal ideas and act . Finally, interpersonal difficulties and social exclusion facilitates risky decision-making , a putative endophenotype of suicide . For example, excluded individuals are more prone to eat non-nutritive foods and to avoid less tasty but nutritive foods that should be preferred for survival . The study of social cognitions - including social rejection and associated psychological pain - and their neural basis is therefore crucial for understanding the suicidal vulnerability, which will shed light on potential therapeutic targets. 

The vulnerability to suicidal behaviour has been associated with the dysfunction of several brain regions and cognitive processes. Notably, suicide attempters showed increased activation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex following exposure to angry faces , suggesting an over-evaluation of emotional negative cues; increased activity in the middle prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex when recalling the psychological pain experienced during the suicidal episode ; and reduced activation of the ventral prefrontal cortex during risky choices  and the anticipation of rewards , both associated with risky decision-making. A study in depressed patients suggests that psychological pain is associated with increased perfusion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in inferior frontal gyrus, but also in occipital cortex and in inferior temporal gyrus . Altogether, it is hypothesised that the development of unbearable psychological pain following perception of social threat or rejection may lead to choose options (i.e. suicidal act) with short-term reward (i.e. relief from pain) in spite of the risks (i.e. death) in vulnerable individuals, partially relying on prefrontal cortex. Moreover, several neuroimaging studies in suicide attempters suggest that brain alterations associated with the suicidal vulnerability extend beyond the prefrontal cortex, notably the temporal and parietal cortices , known to be involved in processing social cognitions . However, to date, no study has specifically investigated response to social rejection in vulnerable individuals i.e. those with a history of suicidal acts. 

In the present study, we used a validated paradigm of social exclusion, the Cyberball Game . During this task, the participant plays a virtual ball-tossing game with two supposedly real other participants. However, he/she is not informed that he/she will progressively be excluded from the game by the two other participants who will continue to play together. A recent meta-analysis reported that three main areas were reliably recruited during the exclusion phase of the Cyberball task: the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the inferior orbitofrontal cortex . Intriguingly, these results therefore show a relative overlap with the brain regions previously associated with the vulnerability to suicidal acts . In order to focus on the vulnerability to suicidal acts, we compared patients with vs. without a history of suicidal acts to control for the effect of comorbid disorders (mood disorders here). Moreover, patients were euthymic at time of scanner to exclude the effect of acute depressive state and a large sample of participants was recruited to allow sufficient statistical power. 


## Results 
  
### Sociodemographic and clinical data 
  
There were no between-group differences for sociodemographic variables (Table  ).

 Footnotes  : HC = Healthy Controls; PC: Patient Controls; SA: Suicide Attempters; KW: Kruskal Wallis test; MW: Mann Whitney test; NART: National Adult Reading Test; HDRS: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale; BDI: Beck Depression Inventory; BIS: Baratt Impulsiveness Scale; STAI: Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAXI: Spielberger State-Trait Anger Inventory; CTQ: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; NTS: Need Threat Scale; RRRS: Risk and Rescue Rating Scale; SIS: Suicide Intent Scale; OCD: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; GAD: Generalized Anxiety Disorder; NA = Not Applicable. 
  

As expected, HC had lower levels of subclinical depressive symptoms (BDI score only), anxiety-state and -trait, and anger-state and –trait than both patient groups. They also experienced less often childhood trauma (excepted sexual abuse). 

SA had a median number of suicide attempt of 2 (min-max: 1–10), and a median age at first suicide attempt of 22 (11–43) years old. SA had higher numbers of past depressive episodes than PC (3.5 (1–13) vs. 2 (1–50) respectively, p < 10–2). Number of past depressive episodes was therefore used as covariate in the subsequent neuroimaging analyses in comparisons between patient groups (i.e. PC vs. SA). While medication was equally distributed across groups, we nevertheless controlled for this variables in analyses. 

Following the Cyberball game, PC and SA had higher mean scores of social distress than HC, with no difference between SA and PC (63.5 (41–96), 65 (40–96) vs. 54 (31–87) respectively, p = 0.01). 


### Functional MRI 
  
#### Within-group analyses 
  
ANOVA analysis revealed a main effect of condition in left anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area [BA] 13 extending to BA45, peak voxel: −43 18 7, 11 voxels, F = 14.9; Z = 5.2; voxel p-FWE = 0.002) in HC (Fig.  ), but not in PC and SA. Post hoc analyses in HC showed greater activation for both explicit social exclusion (ESE) and implicit social exclusion (ISE) vs. inclusion (INC) in anterior insula. This region has previously been associated with this contrast in healthy subjects in a recent meta-analysis .

#### Between-group analyses 
  
ANOVA analyses revealed a group by condition interaction only for ESE vs. INC for two clusters located in left supramarginal gyrus (BA40 extending to BA13; peak voxel: −39 −36 18; 23 voxels; F = 25.2; Z = 6.28; voxel p-FEW <10 ) and posterior insula (BA13; peak voxel: −39 −16 13; 10 voxels; F = 18.10; Z = 5.3; voxel p-FWE = 0.001) (Fig.  ). Post-hoc analyses showed decreased activation in these regions in SA relative to both PC (after covarying for number of past depressive episodes and medication) and HC (without covariates). These results were unchanged when mood disorder type or social phobia were used as covariates.

For explanatory purposes, Fig.   presents extracted beta-values for the two contrasts in the three groups. Graphs show different patterns of responses in the two clusters. In left BA40, SA showed a larger deactivation during exclusion (whether implicit or explicit), while in left posterior insula, there was a diminished deactivation during exclusion in SA.

Footnotes: SA: Suicide attempters; PC: Psychiatric controls; HC: Healthy controls; ESE: explicit social exclusion; ISE: implicit social exclusion; INC: inclusion. 
  

There were no significant correlations between brain activations for ESE vs. INC at the two clusters and clinical measures of level of childhood maltreatment, anxiety, anger, impulsivity and social distress measures. There were no significant correlations between decreased cerebral activations for ESE vs. INC and number of previous suicide attempts as well as intent and lethality of the most recent and most severe suicide attempts. 




## Discussion 
  
This first study exploring the neural basis of the experience of social exclusion in SA showed two main results. Using the self-administered scale (NTS), both patient groups, although euthymic, experienced more distress than HC during the Cyberball Game, with no difference between patient groups. However, functional neuroimaging was able to discriminate patients with vs. without a history of suicidal behavior. Indeed, during the exclusion phase of the Cyberball Game, patients with a history of suicidal acts showed a different activation in left posterior insula and supramarginal gyrus (two interconnected regions ) compared with both psychiatric and healthy controls. First, comparing the three groups we found a reduced activity of the posterior insula in SA vs. both groups of controls during exclusion. More precisely, the posterior insula showed a reduced deactivation in SA during ESE vs. INC. While not significant, this seems to be also the case during ISE vs. INC suggesting a general alteration in brain processing of exclusion. Previous studies have reported structural, metabolic abnormalities and modified connectivity of the insula in suicidal vulnerability . The posterior part of insula has been involved in interoceptive information  and pain . In borderline personality disorder patients, enhanced physical pain tolerance has been associated with decreased activation of insula during pain processing in comparison to controls . Thus reduced activity of the posterior insula in our sample may be a correlate of higher tolerance to pain via repeated exposure—and attendant habituation—to painful and provocative experiences in subjects vulnerable for suicide, as suggested by the interpersonal theory of suicide . Indeed, insula is part of the network underlying the acquired capability for suicide , which would facilitate lethal suicidal act when occurring simultaneously with thwarted belongingness (i.e., loneliness and lack of reciprocity) and perceived burdensomeness (i.e., feeling like a liability on others). Interestingly, in a prospective 2-year observational PET study, Oquendo   et al.   showed that greater 5HT  receptor binding potential in insula predicted more lethal attempts in depressed subjects . 

Second, we also found a different activity in the supramaginal gyrus in SA vs. both groups of controls during exclusion, with larger deactivation during ESE vs. INC. Reduced volumes of bilateral inferior parietal lobe have previously been reported in SA . Additionally, using magnetization transfer imaging, Chen   et al.   reported impaired macromolecular structural integrity in left inferior parietal lobe in SA relative to non-attempters and HC . Inferior parietal lobe is known to be involved in social cognition , but also in first/third person perspective-taking . Interestingly, in our study, this region did not show the same pattern of activation during ESE and ISE condition (vs. INC) in HC: left supramarginal gyrus was activated during ESE (when participants are excluded by the others) but deactivated during ISE (when particpants are told they will not participate for technical reasons) in HC. In SA, it was deactivated in both conditions suggesting that SA have difficulties taking into account the context in exclusion conditions. 

Third, we have not found significant differences of activation in orbitofrontal cortex in SA as hypothesized. It may suggest that increased lateral orbitofrontal activation in SA when viewing angry faces  may reflect a hypersensitivity to reprobation or conflict more than to social rejection   per se  . Overall, current and previous findings support a significant and sustained sensitivity to social stressors in individuals at-risk of suicide. 

Our study has several limitations. First, most of our patients were taking medications during this study. This may have influenced final findings. However, the distribution of different classes of drugs was similar between the two patient groups, which have been taken into account in analyses between patients. Moreover, patients presented with various comorbidities. In the present study, we chose not to exclude medicated patients (except patients with benzodiazepines) or patients with several comorbidities in order to maintain a reasonable level of representativeness. Importantly, when controlling for medication, mood disorder type or social phobia, our main results remained unchanged. Second, the naturalistic validity of the game is questionable as is the sensitivity of the questionnaire to measure distress at the end of the scanning session. Alternative investigations will have to be conducted. However, even if Cyberball game is not reflecting what individuals experience in their daily social interactions, Eisenberger   et al.   have shown strong relationships between neural activity during this experimental task and real-world feelings of rejection. Moreover, individuals who are the most sensitive to experimental social rejection in the scanner are also the most sensitive to these types of experiences in their everyday lives. Third, only female participants were recruited here, enabling to exclude a gender effect and give sufficient statistical power. A similar study deserves to be conducted in men because behavioural and biological differences have been reported during Cyberball game according to gender as well as evidence for gender paradox in suicidal process. Fourth, Cyberball non-randomized block design may involve a risk of failure of non-sphericity in the low frequency range by using parametric instead non-parametric thresholding. But we decided to perform parametric analyses as always done in previous studies using this paradigm. 

The main strengths of our study are the large sample size and assessment of euthymic patients to capture traits of suicidal vulnerability. The Cyberball game had never been used in subjects having a history of suicide attempt. Studies exploring influence of social stressors in vulnerable subjects are very relevant in suicidal process. Our results suggest a role for the left posterior insula and parietal regions in sensitivity to social exclusion as part of the suicidal vulnerability in women, and raise the question of the role of social perception and physical pain in the suicidal process. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Three groups of euthymic female participants were recruited: (1) suicide attempters (SA)—individuals with a past history of both major depressive episode and suicidal behaviour; (2) patient controls (PC)—individuals with a past history of major depressive episode but no personal history of suicidal acts; (3) healthy controls (HC)—individuals with no past history of any major DSM-IV axis I diagnosis. 

Healthy controls were recruited through advertisement and among a list of volunteers from the Montpellier Academic hospital database. Patients were recruited among outpatients of the Department of Emergency Psychiatry & Post Acute Care from the Montpellier Academic hospital. Participants were first screened for inclusion criteria and then in person by a psychiatrist. All participants were Caucasian right-handed (as assessed by the Edinburgh scale ) females. Only females were included in this study to avoid any gender effects that may blur the results, insure a sufficient statistical power, and because most previous studies using the Cyberball game were conducted with females. 

Suicidal behaviour was defined as any act carried out with some intent to die. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.0.0. All participants had to be euthymic at the time of scanning, as indicated by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score < 7 and a Young Mania Rating Scale score < 7. Other exclusion criteria were a lifetime history of severe head trauma, CNS disorder, schizophrenia, and a history of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence within the past 12 months. 

Local Ethics Committee (CPP Sud Mediterranée IV, CHU Montpellier) approved the study protocol. All experimental methods were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines determined by the National Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before entering the study. Subjects received 100€ for their participation in the study. 

In total, 120 participants were examined. Two HC were unable to remain in the scanner because of anxiety. For technical reasons, data from two PC were not available. Moreover, we excluded from analyses patients taking benzodiazepines. In sum, data from 36 SA, 41 PC, and 28 HC were analyzed. 


### Clinical assessment 
  
We administered the French version of the National Adult Reading Test (NART)  to provide an estimate of verbal IQ; the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for a subjective measure of depressive state; the Spielberger Anxiety Scale (STAI)—state  for current level of anxiety; and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI)-state  for current level of anger. The lethality and the intent of the last and the most severe (according reported medical consequences) suicidal acts were assessed with the Risk Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS) and the Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) . 

We also assessed various personality traits including impulsivity with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-10) , trait anger with the STAXI-trait , and trait anxiety with the STAI-trait . Finally, we measured a history of childhood maltreatment with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) . 


### Cyberball Game 
  
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired while participants played the Cyberball game, a virtual ball-tossing game . The Cyberball game is a validated paradigm to study social exclusion and has been widely used in fMRI studies. Participants were instructed that they would play with two other players, also in fMRI scanners. In reality, participants were playing with a preset computer program and were given a cover story to ensure that they believed the other players were real. The Cyberball game comprises three successive conditions. In the first condition (Implicit Social Exclusion, ISE), the participant watched the other “players” play the Cyberball game. Participants were told that, because of technical difficulties, the link to the other two scanners could not yet be made and thus, at first, they would only watch but not play with the other two players. This cover story was intended to allow participants to view a scene visually identical to the exclusion condition (Explicit Social Exclusion, ESE) without participants experiencing exclusion by the other participants. In the second condition (inclusion, INC), participants played with the other two players and received the ball as many times as virtual players. In the final condition (ESE), participants were progressively excluded with the two other players not throwing the ball to the participant anymore. Each run consisted of 60 throws by condition, i.e. 180 throws in total for the whole session. The computer players waiting 0.5–3.0 seconds before making a throw to heighten the sense that the participant was actually playing with other individuals. ESE included 8 throws to the participant during an initial transition phase toward total exclusion. 

Following completion of the Cyberball task, participants completed the Need-Threat Scale (NTS)  to measure social distress associated with being excluded during the game. The NTS assesses 12 subjectively experienced consequences of being excluded during the game, including ratings of self-esteem (“I felt liked”), belongingness (“I felt rejected”), meaningfulness (“I felt invisible”), and control (“I felt powerful”), on a scale ranging from 1 = “not at all” to 5 = “very much”. Items were reverse-coded when appropriate and averaged to create a composite score. 


### Image Acquisition 
  
Imaging acquisition was done in the Neuroradiology Department - I2FH (Academic Hospital of Montpellier) - using a 1.5T whole-body MRI system (MAGNETON AVANTO, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a standard 12-channel receive-only head coil. Sixty volumes of BOLD echo planar images (EPI) were obtained during the Cyberball Game. Gradient-Echo EPI images characteristics were as follows: TR = 2 sec, TE = 40 ms, FOV = 220 mm, 25 axial slices (5 mm slice thickness), slice gap = 0.5 mm, voxel size = 3.43 × 3.43 × 5 mm, flip angle 90°. The slices were covering a region extending from the vertex to lower parts of the cerebellum. 

A 3D magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence was also obtained for each participant with the following parameters: TR = 2100 ms, TE = 4.1 ms, IR = 1100 ms, 15° flip angle, PAT = 2, aligned with the corpus callosum, voxel-size 0.98 × 0.98 × 1 mm, 160 transversal slices. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
Data were analyzed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) implemented in Matlab R2015 (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) using a block-designed model. The 5 first volumes of each fMRI run were discarded due to the time of launch of the Cyberball task synchronized with fMRI acquisition. The following 55 volumes were retained for functional analysis for each condition (ISE, INC and ESE). In total 165 volumes were analyzed. EG-EPI data were re-oriented to the anterior commissure, slice-time corrected, realigned to the first volume, co-registered, normalized to T1 template (provided by Montreal Neurological Institute MNI), and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian filter. 

Contrast images were estimated for ESE vs. INC, ISE vs. INC and ESE vs. ISE conditions for every participant using a first-level general linear model. Realignment parameters have been added in the regressor to remove specific activation of head movement of the subject and 128 seconds high-pass filter was used to remove non-physiological slow signal shifts. To check the validity of our experiment, we first conducted a one-way ANOVA at the whole brain level for the main effect of condition in HC. Significance threshold was set at voxel level p < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons with k ≥ 10 voxels. Then, we conducted a twoway mixedmodel ANOVA, at the whole-brain level for the interaction between Group and Condition. Significance threshold was set at voxelwise FWE-corrected p < 0.05, with k ≥ 10 voxels. Post hoc tests were performed using two sample T-tests with an inclusive mask of regions showing a significant group by condition interaction in the ANOVA (voxel p-uncorrected p < 0.001, k ≥ 10 voxels). The website   http://sprout022.sprout.yale.edu/mni2tal/mni2tal.html   and xjView toolbox were used for anatomical localization. Coordinates are reported in Talairach space. Beta values were then extracted to measure correlations with social distress scores and clinical variables. 


### Statistical Analyses 
  
Clinical and behavioral analyses were carried out with SPSS Statistics 23 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago). Clinical and behavioural quantitative data were compared between the three groups with Kruskal-Wallis tests and between pairs of groups with Mann-Whitney U tests. Associations between qualitative variables and groups were calculated with chi-square tests. All correlation analyses of brain activation with clinical measures were conducted using Spearman test. The alpha level was set   a priori   at 0.05.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>   Summary  
Learning induces plasticity in neuronal networks. As neuronal populations contribute to multiple representations, we reasoned plasticity in one representation might influence others. We used human fMRI repetition suppression to show that plasticity induced by learning another individual’s values impacts upon a value representation for oneself in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a plasticity also evident behaviorally in a preference shift. We show this plasticity is driven by a striatal “prediction error,” signaling the discrepancy between the other’s choice and a subject’s own preferences. Thus, our data highlight that mPFC encodes agent-independent representations of subjective value, such that prediction errors simultaneously update multiple agents’ value representations. As the resulting change in representational similarity predicts interindividual differences in the malleability of subjective preferences, our findings shed mechanistic light on complex human processes such as the powerful influence of social interaction on beliefs and preferences.

## Introduction 
  
Information in the brain is encoded within distributed neuronal populations such that individual neurons typically support more than one representation or computation. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), for example, perform self-referential as well as social value computations ( ). Whereas it is traditionally suggested that computations for self and other are performed within separate populations of neurons ( ), recent work suggests a functional organization within this region does not neatly conform to such a distinction by agent. Instead, value computations on behalf of any individual can be realized by the same circuitry ( ), and the neural code depends only on the subjective value of an offer. In light of this, we conjectured that multiple value computations might be updated simultaneously if plasticity is introduced into this circuitry. 

The contribution of overlapping neural circuitry to distinct computations has previously been demonstrated during delegated inter-temporal choice ( ). In inter-temporal choice paradigms, subjects reveal their preferences for larger reward delivered later versus smaller reward that arrive sooner. Choice in this context is quantified by a “temporal discount rate” ( ), believed to index forms of behavioral impulsivity ( ) and an ability to imagine future outcomes ( ). When subjects are asked to make such inter-temporal choices on behalf of another individual (“delegated inter-temporal choice”), they rapidly learn the confederate’s discount rate ( ). This adaptability depends on the medial prefrontal cortex, where a neural circuitry used to compute a subject’s own values also computes those of a confederate, enabling rapid switches between the two computations ( ). 

We reasoned that if the same circuitry in the mPFC computes the value of a delayed offer irrespective of agents, plastic changes necessary to learn a new partner’s preferences might have consequences for a subject’s own value computations. The presence of such plasticity would also be expected to induce behavioral change in the subject’s own temporal discount rate, a parameter usually assumed to index a stable personality trait ( ). One can conjecture that such plasticity might underlie social conformity effects, where individuals adjust their beliefs or preferences to align more with those with whom they interact ( ). 

At a neuronal level, a formal test of these predictions requires a fine-grained access to neural populations supporting distinct value computations, as well as a robust measure of learning-induced change in activity of these same populations. Despite its coarse spatial resolution, fMRI can reveal relationships between underlying cellular representations. In particular, fMRI adaptation paradigms can be finessed to measure plastic changes associated with the behavioral pairing of different items ( ). The principle of fMRI adaptation builds on the idea that the repeated engagement of the same neuronal population leads to a diminished response and attenuated BOLD signal, even though the underlying biophysical mechanism remains ambiguous ( ). 

Here we used an fMRI adaptation paradigm to measure the relationship between neuronal value representations for self, a familiar other whose preferences had been learnt prior to scanning and a novel confederate as this latter agent’s preferences were learnt. We deployed a dynamic repetition suppression procedure to provide us with a probe of plastic neural changes associated with learning a new flexible computation. We hypothesized that plasticity associated with this new learning would impact upon the preference representation for self as a consequence of a neuronal representation that maps agent and offer onto an agent-independent measure of subjective value. In essence, this predicts that neuronal value representations between self and a novel other should become more similar with learning, in line with a behavioral shift in preference. An alternative hypothesis posits separate value computations for distinct agents. In such a case, a subject might use their own separate neural representations as a proxy for understanding another’s traits, and an independent neuronal value representation for this other would be constructed through learning-induced plasticity ( ). This alternative scenario predicts that neural value representations for self and other should become less similar with learning. In terms of a mechanism driving such plasticity, we reasoned that the same prediction errors that drive learning about a new partner’s inter-temporal preferences would also induce shifts in the subject’s own discount rate toward that of the partner. 


## Results 
  
### Discount Rates Are Susceptible to Social Influence 
  
To examine whether learning about the preferences of another agent impacts on subjective inter-temporal preferences, we tested 27 subjects on a standard inter-temporal choice task both before, and after, performing the identical task on behalf of a partner ( A and 1B). As in the standard format, subjects deciding for themselves chose between an immediately available smaller reward and a delayed larger reward. The degree to which delay diminishes the value of a reward was then quantified by a discount rate, computed from each subject’s actual choices both before and after the experimental manipulation. The latter involved a context whereby subjects performed the very same task but now chose the option they inferred a confederate would prefer. After each trial they were given feedback about the choice the confederate had actually made, such that they could learn to simulate these choices in future trials. 

Subjects learnt quickly, and accurately, to choose according to a novel partner’s preferences ( C and S1D). Subjects believed that the partner was a human participant playing the game in a neighboring room ( G and S1H). In actual fact, and in part motivated by a need for good experimental control, we delivered feedback of a simulated player with preferences very different from the subjects’ own (see  ). 

Notably, we found that, after learning a partner’s preferences, subjects’ own discount rate shifted in the direction of the partner ( , t  = 3.06, p = 0.006,  C). Their estimate of the novel other’s preferences remained stationary ( , t  = 0.99, p = 0.33) and was not biased toward subjects’ own preferences (t  = 0.49, p = 0.63). This effect is not easily understood as a social norm effect ( ), as we also observed discount rates shifted similarly when subjects were instructed they were deciding on behalf of a computer agent (t  = 3.89, p < 0.001,  F). 

One account of this shift in preference is that it arises out of a simulation of the other’s preferences. In order to test whether such simulation is crucial for this shift or whether the behavior can be explained by simple stimulus- or action-based reinforcement, we designed a category-learning control experiment ( ). This consisted of the same stimuli and actions, but the necessity to simulate another’s discount rate was removed. Subjects were presented with a geometric depiction of a given choice on the screen (x axis: delay of the latter option; y axis: ratio of magnitudes M /M ;  A, right) and instructed to choose according to the location of the dot with respect to an imaginary isoprobability line. Rather than using feedback to update a value simulation, subjects now updated their belief about the orientation of this line. In this scenario, subjects’ discount rates did not shift, indicating that subjects were not merely repeating previous choices they had made on behalf of the other (t  = 0.61, p = 0.55; see  F). This latter finding emphasizes a necessity for preference simulation for another agent in order to modulate a discount rate. 


### Subjective Value Changes Are Induced by Learning 
  
The above account suggests that learning to compute the preferences of another agent induces plastic changes in the neural architecture responsible for personal valuation. This in turn predicts the neural population engaged during the computation of self valuation should change over the course of the experiment. This population should either become closer to that evoked during valuation for the partner if the representational structure of an offer depends solely on its subjective value irrespective of the individual. Alternatively, it should become less close if separate agent-specific representations exist and subjects construct an independent representation for the novel other as a consequence of learning. To test for such change in similarity between neural representations for self and others we interleaved trials from the delegated inter-temporal choice task with “probe” trials in the fMRI scanner. These probe trials enabled us to measure repetition suppression between individuals ( D and 1E). We reasoned that if self and partner valuation mechanisms overlapped more after learning than before, in line with an increase in behavioral similarity, then this predicts greater repetition suppression at the end of the experiment than at the beginning. If, however, subjects constructed a representation of the novel other from their representation of self, then this predicts the very opposite, namely repetition suppression at the beginning of the experiment, which disappears as subjects build a separate representation of the novel partner. 

To be certain that any effects were driven by learning about the partner, as opposed to exercising a choice per se, we introduced a third player (a familiar partner) whose discount rate had been learnt prior to scanning. This controlled for non-specific time-dependent signal changes not associated with learning of new preferences. Thus, our experiment comprised three players: the subject (“self”), a partner whose preferences were learnt prior to scanning (“familiar other”), and a partner whose preferences were learnt during scanning (“novel other”). The familiar and novel others’ choices were simulated based on discount rates placed equally far apart on opposite, and counterbalanced, sides of the subject’s original discount rate. This meant that one partner had a smaller, and the other partner a larger, discount rate than the subject himself. 

We scanned 27 subjects while they performed the two interleaved tasks. In choice trials, as in the behavioral experiment described above, subjects again made inter-temporal choices for themselves and for the two partners. In “probe trials,” subjects performed evaluations serially on behalf of different players, allowing us to measure repetition suppression between the value representations of different individuals ( E). After each choice trial for the novel or the familiar partner, but not after probe trials, subjects were given feedback about the choice the confederate had made. 

In line with our behavioral results, subjects’ discount rates shifted toward the discount rate of the familiar partner during preference learning prior to scanning (t  = 3.17, p = 0.004,  F). During scanning, both subjects’ own discount rate (t  = 3.05, p = 0.006) and subjects’ estimated discount rate of the familiar partner (t  = 2.87, p = 0.008) shifted toward the newly learnt discount rate of the novel partner, with a stronger relative shift evident for subjects’ own discount rate (t  = 2.18, p = 0.04) but comparable absolute shifts (t  = 0.72, p = 0.48). These preference shifts were therefore not simply associated with repeating the partner’s choices but instead are most parsimoniously explained as induced by learning a new individual’s preferences. 


### Plasticity between Neural Representations of Self and Other 
  
To address whether a measured change in subjective preference is linked to plasticity in neural populations computing valuations for self, we focused our analysis on the probe trials. We first established that we could measure repetition suppression by comparing brain activity elicited by simulating values for an agent when preceded by the same agent compared to a situation where an agent was preceded by another agent. Different agents were indicated to the subject by different colors on screen ( D). Unsurprisingly, we observed fMRI adaptation in the visual cortex (p < 0.001, peak t  = 16.93, [30, −61, −8], reported here and in subsequent fMRI analyses as familywise error (FWE) corrected on cluster level,  A) ( ), but also in a network that included mPFC (p = 0.02, peak t  = 5.76, [3, 53, −11]) and left superior temporal sulcus (STS) (p < 0.001, peak t  = 4.95, [−51, −13, −8]). The latter two regions are associated with mentalizing ( ), valuation for self ( ), and valuation for others ( ). While this main effect of repetition suppression does not dissociate visual from agent-specific effects, it confirms that similarity in neural patterns evoked in a valuation network can be indexed by repetition suppression ( ). 

We reasoned that we could use this index of neural similarity to investigate whether the observed shift in subjective preferences was linked to plastic changes in the valuation network. If the neural code depends on the subjective values of a given offer alone, then repetition suppression should emerge between self and novel other over the course of the experiment, given that discount rates for self align with discount rates for the novel other. If, on the other hand, the mPFC encodes value differentially depending on agent, where learning another’s preferences involves the construction of an independent representation of this novel other from a representation of self, then repetition suppression should decrease over the course of the experiment. While a similar change in suppression might also be predicted between novel and familiar others, there should be no such change in suppression between self and familiar other if in fact we are indexing changes induced by new learning. 

We designed a contrast that measured the change in repetition suppression between self and novel other from block 1 to block 3, controlled for by the change in repetition suppression between self and familiar other over the same blocks (see  ). The only brain region to survive whole-brain statistical correction was in mPFC ( B, p = 0.01, peak t  = 3.82, [−12, 53, 1]), although sub-threshold clusters in the left and right STS were also present (p = 0.27, peak t  = 3.77 and p = 0.48, peak t  = 3.38, respectively). This region overlaps with an area involved in self-referential processing and in encoding value on probe trials ( B and S3C). There were no significant effects for the opposite interaction. This change cannot be due to visual effects, as we controlled for these both by inclusion of the familiar agent and separately by the comparison between early and late blocks in the experiment. Consequently, visual regions do not show these condition-specific changes in suppression ( ). Neither can the effect be due to novelty or differences in processing speed, as no differences between main effects of novel and familiar others were seen in this region ( A) or in the response times ( A and S4B). Furthermore, an equivalent contrast measuring the change in suppression between self and novel other, but now controlling for the change in suppression between familiar and novel other, revealed a similar change in activity in an overlapping brain region ( C). Hence, in the mPFC learning the preferences of a novel agent specifically increased repetition suppression between representations of self and this novel partner. 

To further investigate these mPFC suppression effects, we employed a jack-knife procedure across subjects to extract parameter estimates from the cluster of interest. Consistent with the whole-brain analysis, we found a significant change in novel-to-self/self-to-novel suppression ( D, t  = 2.86, p = 0.008), but not in self-to-familiar/familiar-to-self suppression from block 1 to block 3 (t  = 0.64, p = 0.52). The change in novel-to-familiar/familiar-to-novel suppression in the same region of interest (ROI) was in the same direction, but did not reach significance (t  = 1.54, p = 0.14), and was smaller than the change in novel-to-self/self-to-novel suppression (t  = 1.65, p = 0.05). Since overall activity in mPFC for self trials was greater than activity for other trials ( B), sensitivity to repetition suppression may differ depending on the order of the two agents. To explore potential differences, we decomposed the contrasts described above. Changes in repetition suppression between self and novel other were observed in both directions ( E) but were only significant when self trials were the priming and not the test trials ( E; ANOVA: left, F  = 3.39, p = 0.04, right F  = 1.55, p = 0.21). 


### Plasticity in mPFC Predicts Discount Rate Shifts 
  
If the observed behavioral change in preference is related to learning-induced plasticity in value computations, then the increase in representational similarity between self and novel other should predict a subject’s shift in preference. The increase in self-to-novel relative to self-to-familiar suppression over blocks did indeed predict the shift in subjects’ own discount rate toward the novel other (partial correlation, r = 0.54, p = 0.007,  A), but not the same shift in the subjects’ estimate of the familiar other’s discount rate (partial correlation, r = 0.15, p = 0.46,  B), although a direct comparison of these effects in a multiple regression analysis did not reach significance (t  = 0.71, p = 0.24). The shift in subjects’ estimate of the familiar other’s preferences was instead loosely related to an increase in representational similarity between familiar and novel other ( ). The fact that the behavioral estimate for a shift in discount rate was derived from choice trials, whereas the neural plasticity effect was extracted from probe trials, strongly suggests that learning a partner’s choice induces a stable plasticity in regions involved in value computation. 


### Plasticity in mPFC Is Predicted by Surprise Coding in the Striatum 
  
A plausible mechanism for inducing plastic change is surprise or prediction error, which in this context arises when the familiar or the novel partner’s choices diverge from the choice the subjects themselves would have made given the same choice context. Bayes-optimal estimates of this measure (see  ) were reflected in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) ( A, p = 0.04, peak t  = 4.09, [−9, 29, 58]), a region previously associated with surprise coding in monkeys ( ), as well as in both insula and striatum (caudate nucleus), although these did not survive a stringent multiple comparisons correction (right insula: p = 0.16, peak t  = 8.37, [30, 26, −8]; left insula: p = 0.19, peak t  = 6.25, [−33, 26, −5]; left striatum (p = 0.84, peak t  = 3.44, [3, −25, −8]). pMFC and striatum are strongly implicated in the expression of a prediction error type signal in reinforcement learning ( ), as well as in signaling a discrepancy between an individual’s behavior and the behavior of a group ( ). An alternative measure of prediction error, where surprise was quantified as the discrepancy between the predicted choices of the partner and the partner’s actual choices, did not yield significant activity in any area of the brain. A more lenient cluster-defining threshold of p = 0.05 revealed much smaller clusters in a similar network as the first surprise measure that did not survive multiple comparisons correction (e.g. pMFC, p = 1.0, peak t  = 2.72, [6, 35, 40]). 

A striatal prediction error type signal is known to drive learning through an influence on cortico-striatal plasticity ( ). In line with this notion, the BOLD correlate of the surprise about the novel partner’s choices in the striatum predicted the behavioral shift in subjects’ own discount rate ( B, r = 0.50, p = 0.01) as well as the change in self-to-novel versus change in self-to-familiar neuronal suppression over blocks in mPFC ( C, r = 0.41, p = 0.04). No such relationship was evident for pMFC or insula activity and mPFC plasticity (r = 0.04, p = 0.84 and r = 0.14, p = 0.48, respectively). 

Finally, if prediction errors cause plasticity, and plasticity in turn causes the shift in subjects’ discount rate, then plasticity in mPFC should formally mediate the impact of the striatal surprise signal on the shift in discount rate. We used single-level mediation to test this hypothesis ( ). The path model jointly tests three effects required if indeed mPFC plasticity provides the link between a surprise signal and the shift in discount rate: namely, the relationship between striatal surprise effects and mPFC plasticity (path a), the relationship between mPFC plasticity and shift in discount rate (path b), and a formal mediation effect (path ab) that indicates that each explains a part of the discount rate shift covariance while controlling for effects attributable to the other mediator. All three effects were significant in a mediation analysis (path a = 0.15, SE = 0.07, p = 0.04; path b = 0.30, SE = 0.12, p < 0.001; path ab = 0.05, SE = 0.03, p = 0.01,  ), supporting the idea that prediction errors influence the discount rate by inducing mPFC plasticity, which in turn impacts upon choice behavior. Hence, subjects with the largest striatal surprise signal at outcome of choice trials exhibited both the largest changes in representational similarity on probe trials and the largest changes in preferences, suggesting a role for striatal prediction error signals in inducing cortical plasticity and associated behavioral change. 



## Discussion 
  
The brain’s representational architecture involves population codes wherein individual neurons contribute to a multitude of computations. We set out to investigate whether multiple neuronal representations can be updated simultaneously by learning-induced plasticity targeting one computation alone. The approach we developed exploited repetition suppression ( ) to probe the similarity between distinct neural representations ( ) by interleaving probe valuation trials with decision blocks that induced prediction errors and learning. While the biophysical mechanisms underlying fMRI repetition suppression remain ambiguous ( ), in a careful experimental design this approach allows inferences about population coding with respect to precise features of stimuli ( ) or computations ( ). 

We were interested in changes of value representational similarity over time. By asking subjects to evaluate presented options on behalf of themselves, a novel other whose preferences were acquired during on-line scanning and a familiar other whose preferences had previously been learnt, we could interrogate representational similarity in neuronal populations encoding valuation for these three agents. In line with previous reports that highlight a social influence on the valuation of objects ( ), we found learning about the preferences of a novel agent had clear behavioral consequences evident in a shift in subjects’ own, as well as their estimation of a familiar other’s, discount rate. This behavioral effect coincided with an increase in neural representational similarity in the mPFC. This supports a view that value representations in the mPFC are not aligned to the frame of reference of an individual. Instead, the increase in neuronal overlap tied to a shift in behavioral preferences suggests that the mPFC encodes agent-independent representations of subjective value. 

The presence of a learning-induced representational plasticity for value is likely to depend on generic learning mechanisms. The most influential computational account posits a role for a reward prediction error implemented via phasic activity of dopamine neurons ( ), a putative teaching signal for cortico-striatal learning ( ). Prediction errors align with the dimension relevant for learning in a given situation. They manifest as a sensory prediction error when subjects learn to predict a sensory event ( ), a probability prediction error when subjects learn about reward probability ( ), and a social expectancy prediction error when group preferences diverge from subjects’ own valuations ( ). In the current experiment, a prediction error (expressed in pMFC, insula, and striatum) corresponds to the surprise subjects experience when a partner’s choice is incongruent with their own preference. This accords with previous studies demonstrating an expression of a similar signal representing a discrepancy between one’s own and a group’s opinion ( ). Crucially, our results extend on these reports by showing this error coding is directly related to an expression of plasticity in mPFC, a region widely implicated in tracking preferences for stimuli ( ) as well as inter-temporal preferences ( ). 

The mPFC region displaying the change in repetition suppression is a complex and heterogeneous area with strong connections to regions such as the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and insula enabling access to sensory, visceral, and emotional information. It is considered ideally placed for self-referential processing ( ) and for attributing value to stimuli across many reward contexts ( ) and internally generated states ( ). However, a mPFC value computation is also remarkably flexible, and can occur even if direct experience is not available ( ) or if there is a requirement for an abstract model of task structure ( ). This flexibility is vital in social cognition, where a model of the preferences and intentions of another individual needs to be decoupled from the physical and perceptual reality of a subject’s own internal state ( ). Traditionally, it has been suggested that such computations occur in distinct circuitries, where a ventral sector of the mPFC encoding subjective stimulus values ( ) is complemented by a dorsal sector representing the mental states of others ( ). However, this notion is challenged by an observation that a dorsal-ventral axis can be better understood in terms of executed versus modeled choices ( ). The latter observation supports the idea that the very same area encodes subjective value irrespective of the frame of reference, a notion strongly supported by our current observation that a behavioral shift toward the value of a novel agent is mirrored by an increase in neural overlap. 

Irrespective of the exact nature of the observed plasticity, the underlying mechanism would seem to necessitate an overlap in neural populations encoding values for a novel other, self, and a familiar other. How exactly might the brain calculate discounting preferences with neural populations that are prone to the observed shifts in preference? Theoretical studies suggest an agent’s overall preferences might arise out of a summation over a distributed set of discounting units ( ). This is consistent with recordings in rat orbitofrontal cortex demonstrating a distributed encoding of inter-temporal choice parameters across a neuronal population ( ). Similar gradients of discount factors have also been found in the human striatum ( ) and mPFC ( ). This suggests that some neuronal assemblies may represent a preference for fast discounting, favoring smaller-sooner returns, while others favor slow discounting. The discounting preference of each agent would be represented by population codes, implementing sets of weights over these discounting assemblies. The prediction errors a subject perceives when the novel other’s choices differ from what they would have chosen for themselves could in principle change the weights within this pool, resulting in altered populations codes. 

The fact that a common brain region is recruited when computing preferences for self and other might suggest that people initially draw on self-representations to make inferences about another person and only construct a novel representation through learning. Such a mechanism has been observed when constructing a representation for a novel good from a simultaneous activation of familiar components ( ). However, this theory makes opposite neural predictions, as it predicts repetition suppression at the beginning of the experiment as subjects draw on the same representation to choose for self and other. In this scenario a separate representation for a novel other is built over time and would predict disappearance of repetition suppression. Instead, we observe an increase in repetition suppression across time, an effect reminiscent of an increase in similarity between representations observed when subjects repeatedly evoke independent memories ( ). Importantly, we can demonstrate this plasticity is not solely a neuronal phenomenon but also has profound behavioral consequences. 

Our approach uses repetition suppression to provide insight into a similarity in neural representations. Comparable measures of representational content can be obtained by multivariate pattern analysis ( ); however, it is thought the two techniques show a difference in sensitivity to precise features of the neuronal code ( ). Without an explicit measure of MVPA in this study, we are therefore cautious in predicting a comparable increase in similarity between representations for self and a novel other in mPFC when using MVPA. 

Note that subjects grow increasingly familiar with the novel other’s preferences as the task progresses, whereas familiarity remains constant for the familiar other in the sense that there is no new learning in relation to this other. Since psychological constructs such as familiarity, but also similarity and physical proximity, have previously been demonstrated to upregulate mPFC activity ( ), this raises the question whether an increase in familiarity might drive the plasticity effect. Importantly, our data are not consistent with such an account. First, activity for familiar and novel other does not differ in mPFC, not even at the beginning of the experiment, suggesting that the mPFC in our task does not respond to familiarity per se. Second, a mediation analysis suggests that it is a striatal surprise signal, the very opposite of familiarity, that drives the plasticity effect, which in turn drives the behavioral shift. 

Subjects’ own discount rate shifted toward the discount rate of their partner irrespective of whether their partner was human or a computer. This is in line with studies demonstrating that individuals use strategies akin to those used in real social contexts when interacting with a computer agent ( ). Crucially, a control condition with the same stimuli and actions, but without the need to employ a discounting computation, did not evoke a change in subjects’ own preferences. This indicates that the behavioral effect is tied to subjects’ deployment of the very same discounting mechanism to learn on behalf of another agent, be it a human or non-human agent. Thus, it is a learning-induced plasticity in acquiring a novel value representation that impacted on subjects’ own subjective value computation. This also suggests that most subjects do not actively choose to change their preferences but instead do so as the consequence of an mPFC plasticity they are not consciously aware of. Such an implicit mechanism presumably contributes to involuntarily aligning goals with others and might play an important role in spreading values throughout a population ( ). 

In conclusion, our data detail a neuronal mechanism by which personal traits are susceptible to social influence. Such plasticity might be one of the key features underlying learning, because it allows for an integration of past experience with novel information. More broadly, our findings pave the way for further studies of human social interactions at a more mechanistic level. 


## Experimental Procedures 
  
### Subjects 
  
27 volunteers (mean age ± SD: 23.6 ± 3.7, 14 females) participated in the behavioral experiment, and 29 volunteers (mean age ± SD: 25.6 ± 5.6 years, 14 females) participated in the subsequent fMRI experiment. Two subjects were excluded from fMRI analyses, because they had previously participated in the behavioral experiment and because of technical difficulties during the scan. All subjects were neurologically and psychiatrically healthy. The study took place at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging in London, UK. The experimental procedure was approved by the University College London Hospitals Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 


### Task Behavioral Study 
  
For a detailed description of the task and our analyses, see the  . In brief, subjects made a series of choices between a smaller amount paid on the same day and a larger amount paid later ( A). The experiment was divided into three blocks ( B). In the first block, consisting of 100 trials, subjects made decisions for themselves. In block 2, they made decisions on behalf of their partner. They were also provided with trial-by-trial feedback on whether their choice for the partner was correct. Block 2 ended when subjects made 85% correct responses for their partner in a sliding window of 20 trials or after a maximum of 60 trials. In block 3, smaller blocks of ten trials of choosing for self alternated with blocks of ten trials of choosing for the partner. Block 3 ended after a total of 200 trials. Choices were optimized to give us a precise estimate of subjects’ discount rates. 


### Estimation of Discount Rates 
  
We estimated subjects’ discount rates by fitting a hyperbolic model to their choices ( ) separately for each experimental block. Subjects’ shift in discount rates was defined as the change in discount rate from block 1 to block 3 (log k  − log k ) relative to the distance between their estimate of the partner’s discount rate from their own discount rate (log k  − log k ): 

A positive shift represents a movement toward, and a negative shift a movement away from, the partner’s discount rate. Outliers (outside the range mean ± 3⋅SD), as well as subjects who estimated their partner’s discount rate to be less than 0.3 units away from their own discount rate, were excluded from population analyses because of inflated shift estimates (see  E). 


### Simulation of the Other’s Choices 
  
To generate feedback for the confederate’s choices, we simulated a partner with a discount rate that differed from the subject’s own baseline discount rate by 1 (i.e., log k  = log k  ± 1). Choices were correct if they corresponded to the decision that would be preferred by a hyperbolic discounter with this discount rate. Importantly, the simulated partner’s choices were noisy, as the other’s subjective value was translated to a choice probability with a softmax function (temperature parameter β = 1). 


### Task fMRI Study 
  
The fMRI experiment consisted of two trial types: choice trials, as described for the behavioral experiment above, and probe trials, in which subjects evaluated a single option on a scale from 1 to 4 ( D). Subjects learned the preferences of a second partner (“familiar other”) before the scan ( E, top). 

In contrast to the behavioral experiment and the pretraining, subjects learned about the novel other’s discount rate while we assessed their own discount rate. To make sure that we captured a potential shift in discount rate in this scenario, we excluded the first third of all choice trials subjects performed in the scanner when estimating k , k , and k . The relative shift effects reported in  F were then calculated as follows: 

For the estimation of absolute shifts, the denominator z was set to sign(z). Outliers (outside the range mean ± 3 SD) as well as subjects for whom the denominator was smaller than 0.3 (two subjects for shift , three subjects for shift , and two subjects for shift ) were excluded from the analyses. 


### Surprise Measure 
  
We estimated subjects’ own discount rates on a trial-by-trial basis (see  ) and used this measure to compute differences in subjective value for the choices subjects observed their partner make (V  − V ). This difference in subjective value was transformed to a probability using a softmax function applied to a trial-to-trial estimation of subject’s inverse temperature parameter β. This measure gave us an estimate of how likely the subject would have been to make the same choice himself. We subtracted this likelihood from 1 to translate this to a surprise measure. 


### Scan Procedure, fMRI Data Acquisition, and Preprocessing 
  
We used standard procedures for acquiring fMRI data where these were designed to minimize susceptibility related artifacts in the ventral prefrontal cortex ( ). We used SPM8 for image preprocessing and data analysis (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London). We corrected for signal bias, co-registered functional scans to the first volume in the sequence, and corrected for distortions using the fieldmap. Data were spatially normalized to a standard EPI template and smoothed using an 8 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. 


### fMRI Data Analysis 
  
Data were analyzed with an event-related general linear model (GLM). Probe trials were sorted into nine different conditions (self preceded by self [SS], novel preceded by self [SN], familiar preceded by self [SF], self preceded by novel [NS], novel preceded by novel [NN], familiar preceded by novel [NF), self preceded by familiar [FS), novel preceded by familiar [FN], and familiar preceded by familiar [FF]) with 20 trials per condition and block. Each regressor was accompanied by a parametric modulator reflecting subjective value from the respective agent’s perspective. This value was calculated based on a trial-by-trial estimate of the subject’s current belief about their partners’ discount rate k. Furthermore, we defined one choice regressor per agent and block indexing the time at which subjects indicated their decision on choice trials and received feedback. Each was accompanied by a parametric regressor corresponding to the surprise subjects experienced as they observed the partner’s choice. Button presses were included as a regressor of no interest. Because of the sensitivity of the BOLD signal in the OFC region to subject motion and physiological noise, we included six motion regressors obtained during realignment as well as ten regressors for cardiac phase, six for respiratory phase, and one for respiratory volume extracted with an in-house-developed Matlab toolbox as nuisance regressors ( ). Blocks were modeled separately within the GLM. 

To detect areas showing adaptation to repeated agents as depicted in  A, we used the contrast   (i.e.,  ). To test for areas displaying greater increases in suppression between self and the novel other compared to between self and familiar other ( B), we defined the following contrast:  . To test for greater increases in suppression between self and novel other than between novel other and familiar other, we defined a contrast as follows:  . 

The contrast images of all subjects from the first level were analyzed as a second-level random effects analysis. Results are reported at a cluster-defining threshold of p < 0.01 uncorrected combined with a FWE-corrected significance level of p < 0.05. 

We performed a jack-knife procedure from the mPFC ROI ( B) to extract parameter estimates from this region without biasing the selection. To this end, we extracted parameter estimates for each subject from an ROI defined according to all other subjects (threshold at p < 0.01 uncorrected). This signal was used to perform all analyses depicted in   and  A. 

We performed partial correlations to control for correlations between shift  and shift  in our analysis of the relationship of a behavioral shift effect and neural plasticity. This removes the shift of the familiar other toward the novel other from the subjects’ own discount rate shifts and the neural plasticity index [SN − SF]  ( A) and the shift of self toward the novel other from the familiar other’s shift toward the novel other and the neural plasticity index ( B). We also estimated a linear regression model on the same data with shift  and shift  as independent variables and [SN − SF]  as the dependent variable. The relationship between shift  and [SN − SF]  was directly contrasted with the relationship between shift  and [SN − SF] . 

To test for the influence of surprise on mPFC plasticity, we defined a contrast assessing BOLD correlate of the surprise subjects experienced as they got feedback about the novel and the familiar partners’ choices. This contrast revealed activity in ACC, in bilateral insula and dorsal striatum ( A; note that insula and striatal activity did not survive cluster-based FEW thresholding). To identify the surprise experienced when learning about the novel other, parameter estimates were then extracted from these ROIs for the novel other’s choices only. This surprise measure in the striatum was correlated with subjects’ shift in discount rate ( B) and the plasticity measure [SN − SF]  extracted from the mPFC ROI ( C). 

We used the Mediation and Moderation Toolbox ( ) to perform a mediation analysis on this surprise signal, our plasticity measure, and the discount rate shift. 

To test the specificity of adaptation effects, we analyzed repetition suppression effects in visual regions. We defined an ROI from a contrast identifying a main effect to any visual event, averaged across all blocks, and performed the same analyses as for the mPFC ROI (thresholded at p < 0.0001 uncorrected;  ).

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical fMRI study in healthy adults (N=31, mean age 24.3, right-handed, no neurological/psychiatric history). The tasks are social in nature (take-advice game and subsequent trust game) probing perception and understanding of others (honesty/trustworthiness). The paper reports whole-brain, group-level univariate task-evoked contrasts (e.g., honesty vs dishonesty, value-related activations) with voxel-level and cluster-level FWE correction and provides GLM details, coordinates, tables, and figures. Results are clearly from the healthy/control sample and generalizable to healthy adults. The study is not limited to ROI-only or to resting-state/seed-only connectivity; while it includes connectivity and MVPA, it also provides standard whole-brain activation maps. No exclusion criteria are violated. Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria for fMRI studies of social processing in healthy adults.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
In many animal species, social communication and mate choice are influenced by cues encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The mechanism by which the MHC influences sexual selection is a matter of intense debate. In mice, peptide ligands of MHC molecules activate subsets of vomeronasal and olfactory sensory neurons and influence social memory formation; in sticklebacks, such peptides predictably modify the outcome of mate choice. Here, we examine whether this evolutionarily conserved mechanism of interindividual communication extends to humans. In psychometric tests, volunteers recognized the supplementation of their body odour by MHC peptides and preferred ‘self’ to ‘non-self’ ligands when asked to decide whether the modified odour smelled ‘like themselves’ or ‘like their favourite perfume’. Functional magnetic resonance imaging indicated that ‘self’-peptides specifically activated a region in the right middle frontal cortex. Our results suggest that despite the absence of a vomeronasal organ, humans have the ability to detect and evaluate MHC peptides in body odour. This may provide a basis for the sensory evaluation of potential partners during human mate choice.

## Introduction 
  
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are involved in antigen presentation and their structure determines the probability with which a given pathogen will be recognized by the individual's immune system [ ]. Because MHC molecules critically influence the susceptibility to infection, maintenance of a sufficient degree of MHC diversity in natural populations is a key survival parameter in the face of constantly changing pathogen spectra [ – ]. Behavioural mechanisms that guide non-random mating based on MHC genotypes are considered to be a means by which an optimum degree of individual MHC diversity is maintained in the offspring. While there is strong experimental support for MHC-associated behaviour in animals [ – ], including non-human primates [ , ], the situation in humans is more complex. Evidence in favour of MHC-associated behaviour has emerged from studies on the sexual interest of females [ ] and their preferences for certain male body odour [ , ]; studies on the degree of genetic relatedness of mated and unmated couples of the opposite sex have produced mixed results, suggesting a role for MHC genotype in some [ , ] but not all populations [ ]. 

In a double-blind study, Wedekind   et al.   [ ] found that women preferred the odour of shirts worn by men with different MHC alleles to those of men with more closely matching MHC alleles; a similar observation was made with male participants [ ]. These findings (reviewed in [ ]) suggested a relationship between MHC-dependent odour signalling and preference for a specific personal perfume. In a subsequent study with the MHC-typed student cohort originally tested by Wedekind   et al.   [ ], Milinski & Wedekind [ ] tested this prediction directly; participants who shared MHC alleles expressed a strong preference for the same natural perfume ingredient for use on themselves, but not on a potential partner. Thus, because MHC genotypes determine individual perfume preferences, it appears that perfumes function as amplifiers of MHC-related individual body odours [ ]. Indeed, a recent study showed that self-preferred perfumes added to body odour are preferred to perfumes allocated by the investigator and added to the same body odour [ ]. Collectively, these findings may provide an explanation for the fact that humans of all cultures have used fragrances for at least 5000 years and for the observation that persistent interindividual differences exist for the preference of certain perfumes [ ]. 

Recent work on the molecular nature of the chemosensory stimuli underlying MHC-associated behaviour in animals indicates that peptide antigens presented by MHC molecules act as olfactory cues in different species in addition to their well-known function in eliciting immune responses [ – ]. Here, we have examined the ability of humans to recognize and evaluate the modification of their body odour by allele-specific MHC peptide ligands. The present psychophysical and neurophysiological studies suggest that MHC peptide ligands convey information about the MHC genotype and may thus represent at least part of natural MHC-dependent human body odour signals. 


## Material and methods 
  
### Study participants 
  
Female students were recruited from the Universities of Hamburg and Kiel. They were genotyped for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-A and HLA-B [ ] at the University Hospital Hamburg using the reverse SSO line blot assay (Dynal Reli SSO, Invitrogen); note that for historical reasons, the products of the human MHC locus are designated as HLA. This analysis revealed that 19 were positive for HLA-A*02, six were positive for HLA-A*24 (of which two were also positive for HLA-A*02) and nine carried neither HLA-A*02 nor HLA-A*24. In one participant (no. 6), the presence of the A*3002 allele was considered to be functionally equivalent to A*2402, because their peptide specificity is identical [ ]. Sixteen participants carried one or more alleles (in addition to HLA-A*02 or HLA-A*24) with unknown peptide specificity, which were considered to be ‘non-self’; however, given the diversity of residues at anchor positions, the probability that such a ‘non-self’-peptide has the quality of ‘self’ is much less than 0.5; in this case, the effect on our results would be conservative, that is, it would weaken any observed effect. Four participants carried alleles whose peptide specificities are not precisely known, but are unlikely to be identical to those used as a stimulus peptide; if not, their influence would diminish rather than increase the observed effects, because scores would then be given the wrong sign. At the time of performing the psychometric tests, the age of participants was 25.9±0.9 years (mean±s.e.;   n   = 25; range 21–36 years). Details of the study population are summarized in the electronic supplementary material, table S1. 


### Design of peptide ligands 
  
On the basis of known ligand specificities [ ], nonamer peptides were synthesized and purified by Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH (Ulm, Germany). The peptides and their cognate HLA alleles are listed in the electronic supplementary material, table S2. 


### Psychometric test procedure 
  
Participants were provided with a perfume-free body soap, an untreated cotton T-shirt and two pairs of two bottles per test day containing synthesized HLA ligand peptides, specific for either HLA A*0201 or HLA A*2402 (0.005 mM in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), or solvent (PBS). After a shower using the body soap and wearing the T-shirt overnight, the participant put four drops from bottle 1 in her left hand and rubbed them under her right armpit, then put four drops from bottle 2 in her right hand and rubbed them under her left armpit. In mice [ ] and sticklebacks [ ], MHC peptide ligands elicit a behavioural response only when accompanied by a natural validating factor. We assumed that validation is also necessary in humans and that it is likely to be produced by certain glands in the armpit [ – ]. The participant was then asked to evaluate the smell of each of her armpits by sniffing repeatedly from a close distance and to decide whether one side, and if so, which side, smells like herself or a perfume she would like to smell on herself (‘would you like to smell like this?’). She marked on a questionnaire ‘I prefer for myself the smell of my left armpit/my right armpit; I do not smell a difference; if I have a preference, it is weak, medium or strong.’ The following night, wearing the same T-shirt, the protocol was repeated with bottles 3 and 4; this time sides allocated to peptide and solvent were swapped in order to control for possible side effects [ ]. In the questionnaire, the participants were asked about their smoking habits, their use of contraceptive medication, and whether they had a cold during the test. Participants took part in two to six of such test sessions depending on availability at intervals of at least three months. 


### Data analysis for psychometric test 
  
The psychometric tests were carried out in a double-blind fashion and the results of the genotype were revealed only after completion of the tests. The scores assigned to ‘non-self‘ stimuli were subtracted from scores given to ‘self’ stimuli (resulting in positive values when self is preferred to non-self (see text for details)); the following scores could be given: no preference, 0; weak preference, 1; medium preference, 2, strong preference, 3. Data from each participant were averaged and only the average entered into the analysis to avoid pseudo-replication. 


### Functional magnetic resonance imaging study: participants 
  
Twenty-two right-handed women participated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study; medical histories indicated that all participants were in good health. Olfactory function, assessed by means of ‘Sniffin Sticks’, (Burghart, Wedel, Germany) [ ] was compatible with a normal sense of smell for all but one person who was excluded from the analysis; two further participants had to be excluded from the analysis, one because of pronounced brain abnormalities, the other because of technical problems with the dataset. Data from participants 15–33 (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1 for details of the study population) were processed. At the time of the fMRI studies, the age of participants was 27±1.1 years (mean±s.e.;   n   = 19; range 18–35 years). 


### Functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure 
  
The study was performed with a 1.5 T MR-scanner (Sonata; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Peptide solutions were prepared from lyophilized stocks at a final concentration of 25 mM in PBS. Peptide and mock control solutions were prepared using the same type of plastic ware (50 ml polypropylene Falcon tubes; BectonDickinson). Two peptide solutions, the solvent control, and an additional odour (peach) were presented to both nostrils in a total of eight sessions. Peach is an odour known to cause reliable activation in olfactory-relevant areas and was therefore used as a control to ascertain the validity of the experiment; the solvent without peptides also generated activation of olfactorily relevant areas, presumably owing to contaminants in the plastic containers used. The order of the sessions using peptides or solvent was counterbalanced between participants. Peach was always presented in sessions 7 and 8. To focus their attention on self-assessment, participants were instructed that, after each session, they would be asked to rate the quality of odours on a scale of 0–10 (0, I would not like to smell like this at all; 10, I would very much like to smell like this). Each experimental session comprised six on/off blocks lasting 20 s each. Participants were blind to compound identity. The odours were applied to the participants using a computer-controlled olfactometer (Sommer, Mannheim; Germany). Stimuli were embedded in a constant flow of odourless air (total flow 2 l min ). The stimuli were directed through a small tube from the olfactometer to the participants' noses. During the ‘on’-blocks odourized air was intermittently (1 s air, followed by 2 s pause) delivered to the nasal cavity, at a rate of 2 l min . During the ‘off’-block, participants received pulses of odourless air. With respect to the intensity of the odours, participants reported no significant differences between solvent (8.4±3.6 (mean±s.d.)), self-peptide (9.4±4.7) and non-self-peptide (8.5±4.1) (scores, from undetectable odour (0) to very strong odour (20) (the scores from applications to both nostrils were totalled for the analysis); control peach odour intensity rating, 16.4±3.6). These results indicate that self-peptide and non-self-peptide stimuli were presented supraliminally. With respect to the preference as self-odours, no significant differences were observed when the participants gave their scores after the short exposure to each odour during the individual sessions of the fMRI experiment (solvent, 9.1±3.7; self-peptide, 7.3±3.5; non-self-peptide, 8.8±2.7). Note the different experimental design of the psychometric test that involves a comparative rather than an independent assessment of odours without time restrictions. 

For functional brain activation data, 96 volumes per session were acquired by means of a 26 axial-slice matrix 2D spin-echo/echo-planar sequence (repetition time (TR): 2500 ms/echo time (TE): 40 ms, matrix = 64 × 64, voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm³). Following the fMRI sessions, a T1-weighted image was acquired by using a T1-MPR sequence (TR: 2180ms/TE: 3.9 ms; TI 1100 ms, matrix 352 × 384).

Data analysis was performed with SPM 8 software (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology at University College London, UK), implemented in M  R2007b (Math Works Inc., Natick, MA, USA), following spatial pre-processing with the same software (spatial filtering: high-pass filter 128 Hz, registering, realignment, co-registration between functional and structural images, normalization using segmentation procedure, smoothing by means of 6 × 6 × 6 mm  FWHM Gaussian kernel). Motion parameters were included as covariates. Activation coordinates are presented in MNI space. SPM-matrices reflecting the ON–OFF differences were calculated for each session and participant. Analysis was based on the general linear modelling approach. Individual SPM-contrasts were subjected to a full-factorial second level analysis with the two conditions ‘side’ (two: left, right) and ‘substance’ (four: two peptides in solvent, solvent, additional odour (peach)). Whole brain analysis and small volume region of interest (ROI) analysis were performed for seven cortical areas previously reported to be related to self-processing: right middle frontal cortex, superior and inferior parietal cortex and fusiform cortex [ ], right inferior frontal and anterior cingulated cortex and left insular cortex [ ]. Masks were created using the aal atlas [ ] embedded in the WFU P A  v. 2.4 software [ ]. Four   t  -contrasts were calculated (‘self’-peptide minus solvent, ‘self’-peptide minus ‘non-self’-peptide, ‘non-self’-peptide minus solvent, ‘non-self’-peptide minus ‘self’-peptide). A comparative analysis of activated brain areas resulting from exposure to two different olfactory stimuli tends to cancel out olfactory areas and instead highlights differentially activated regions only, such as those activated by either self or non-self-peptides. Note that the solvent control also activated olfactory regions, presumably owing to the presence of trace contaminants in the disposable plastic containers used throughout the study; therefore, subtractive analysis was considered the most reliable approach to reveal peptide-induced activation. Moreover, activation of a certain brain area was considered to be present only when signals were detected in a particular region for both self-peptide versus solvent and self-peptide versus non-self-peptide, or non-self-peptide versus solvent and non-self-peptide versus self-peptide, respectively. Analysis was based on   t  -tests with global height threshold   p   < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected for the seven search areas and extent threshold of   k   = 3. Additionally, the family-wise error (FWE) rates for activations found within the search areas are presented. 



## Results 
  
### Psychometric assessment of body odour 
  
In a first set of experiments with human volunteers, we examined self-assessment of natural body odour emanating from the armpits after supplementation with prototypic MHC peptide ligands. Hence, in contrast to previous studies, our experimental paradigm specifically focused on self-preference. As expected from HLA allele frequencies in the catchment area for our study population, 18 out of 22 participants were positive for either HLA-A2 or HLA-A24 alleles (or both; electronic supplementary material, table S1), justifying the use of two prototypic peptide ligands (SLLPAIVEL for HLA-A2 and KYPENFFLL for HLA-A24; electronic supplementary material, table S2) as self and non-self stimuli in the double-blind study design (see §2 for details). In individual test sessions, comparisons were made for peptide versus solvent, or A2 versus A24 peptides. The participants were asked to apply two different solutions to their left and right armpits on two consecutive days and then to compare the smell of both armpits (see §2 for details). In the solutions provided to the participants for the second day, the contents were exchanged relative to the previous session to control for potential side bias. Participants had to decide which armpit smelled ‘like themselves’ (or ‘like their favourite perfume’). They were also asked if their preference was weak, medium or strong, or whether they detected no difference between the two armpits. 

In the participants positive for HLA-A2, but negative for HLA-A24, the scores for the armpit exposed to HLA-A2 peptide (‘self’) were given positive values, the scores for the armpit exposed to HLA-A24 peptide or solvent (both ‘non-self’ relative to the HLA-A2 peptide) were given negative values. For the participants negative for HLA-A2, but positive for HLA-A24, only the scores for the armpits exposed to HLA-A24 peptide (‘self’) were given positive values. For HLA-A2/HLA-A24 double-positive participants, the scores for either peptide (‘self’) were given positive, those for solvent (‘non-self’) negative values; for HLA-A2/HLA-A24 double-negative participants, the scores for solvent were given positive (‘self’, relative to peptides) and the scores for either peptide (‘non-self’) negative values. We also recorded whether participants were smokers or had a cold when they carried out the test. Individual scores were averaged across all test sessions. When the data for all sessions of non-smokers without a cold were analysed (two-tailed Wilcoxon one-sample test; average preference compared with 0), a significant preference for the ‘self’ side was found (  n   = 17 participants (total number of trials = 37; average number of trials per participant = 2.2±0.3 s.e.m),   z   = −2.394,   p   = 0.0167, two-tailed;  ). When the sessions of the same cohort with a cold were examined, no significant difference was found (  n   = 12,   z   = −0462,   p   = 0.647, two-tailed); similarly, sessions of smokers without a cold failed to show a difference (  n   = 4,   z   = −0.365,   p   = 0.715, two-tailed;  ). Thus, the preference for ‘self’ (either self-peptide or solvent) to ‘non-self’ (either non-self-peptide or solvent) was clearly evident when all participants with potential impairment of their sense of smell (smoking and/or cold) [ , ] were omitted.
   
Preference for body odour supplemented with ‘self’ stimuli. Participants indicated preference on a scale from +3 to −3. Although participants took part in several trials, only the mean values were used to avoid pseudo-replication. Preference is shown for all sessions of non-smokers without a cold (left), non-smokers with a cold (middle), and smokers without a cold (right). Mean±s.e.m.; *  p   = 0.0167, two-tailed. 
  


### Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
  
The results of the above psychometric tests indicate that human participants are capable of recognizing modifications of their body odour by MHC peptides. Our aim was to confirm this distinct perceptual capacity using fMRI. For this, peptides were delivered to the nostrils of study participants in aerosolized form, and the activation of particular brain areas was determined. To focus the attention of participants on self-assessment, they were asked to rate whether they preferred to smell like the presented odour and to repeat this after each session (see §2 for details). Eleven of 19 participants (all right-handed) included in this analysis had also participated in the psychometric tests (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1). Four different stimuli (solvent; ‘self’-peptide; ‘non-self’-peptide; peach odour as control) were delivered to both nostrils in eight consecutive sessions (see §2 for details). Peptide stimuli (see the electronic supplementary material, table S2) were selected according to the HLA genotype of the test participants (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1). ROI analysis was performed for seven cortical areas previously reported to be related to self-processing: right middle frontal cortex, superior and inferior parietal cortex and fusiform cortex, right inferior frontal and anterior cingulated cortex, and left insular cortex [ , , ]. ‘Self’-peptides induced specific activation in the right middle frontal region, when compared with both solvent (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI, coordinates (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ) = 26,32,32;   P   < 0.001) and ‘non-self’-peptides (MNI (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ) = 28,32,34;   P   < 0.001;  ). Middle frontal structures are known to be involved in cognitive self-representation [ ]. By contrast, activation induced by ‘non-self’-peptides was much weaker, as expected from the ‘self’-centric paradigm of the study; in this case,   t  -values were lower and the overlap of activated regions resulting from comparisons of non-self-peptide versus solvent and of non-self-peptide versus self-peptide was less obvious (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S1). The peach odour elicited robust activation of olfactory brain areas (see the electronic supplementary material, table S3). Collectively, these results indicate that ‘self’-peptides elicit a response in a distinct brain region.

## Discussion 
  
The non-classical function of MHC peptides as activating cues for sensory neurons of the olfactory system provides a mechanistic explanation for the role of MHC alleles in guiding behavioural decisions in a variety of contexts and animal species. Our study suggests that MHC peptide ligands may play a similar role in humans. In a behavioural paradigm of self-preference, participants considered the modification of their body odour by ‘self’-peptides more desirable than the modification by ‘non-self’-peptides, indicating that MHC peptide ligands comprise a functionally relevant component of human body odour. These findings are in keeping with previous observations that humans sharing specific MHC alleles also share a preference for particular natural perfume ingredients [ ] and posit that perfumes may contain structurally diverse peptide mimics. Interestingly, customers usually buy perfumes for their own use [ ] and have always done so [ ]. If perfumes are indeed chosen to reveal and/or enhance one's own body odour [ , ], it is not surprising that one dislikes on others what one likes for oneself [ ]. This switch of choice preference with respect to perfume usage might be explained by ‘phenotype-matching’ [ ], a process that is also implicated in kin-recognition. 

Remarkably, exposure to MHC peptide ligands activated specific brain regions, indicating that humans, despite lacking a functional vomeronasal organ [ ], possess the sensory facility to recognize the presence of MHC-associated olfactory cues. It is possible therefore that peptides activate sensory neurons located in the main olfactory epithelium, as was observed in mice [ ]. Our results are compatible with the notion that the right middle frontal region is a multimodal convergence zone [ ] that might provide the anatomical basis for self-referentiality by integrating various extero- and interoceptive inputs, including peptide stimuli. Notably, the activation of particular brain regions by exposure to peptides does not reflect the precise chemical structure of MHC peptides but rather their ‘self’ or ‘non-self’ qualities relative to the individual's MHC genotype. This suggests the presence of an internal reference for MHC genotype and is reminiscent of an equivalent facility in MHC-associated behavioural decisions in mice [ , ] and sticklebacks [ ]. Hence, our study suggests that, as in mice and fish, sensory evaluation of MHC diversity through the recognition of structurally diverse MHC ligands may be involved in human MHC-associated behaviour.

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This fMRI study used a social-related task (face encoding/social cognition) and includes a separate typically-developing healthy control group (n=11; mean age 18.7, within 17–65). The paper reports whole-brain, group-level univariate voxelwise analyses for the control group (Dm effect; tables of significant clusters with Talairach coordinates and figures), corrected for multiple comparisons. Results for the healthy/control group are reported separately and are generalizable to healthy adults. The study is empirical and task-based (not limited to ROI-only, connectivity-only, or resting-state). Therefore it meets all inclusion criteria and violates none of the exclusion criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an original fMRI study of social cognition in healthy adults (N=22, ages 19–32). The task probes social-related processing (identification and attribution of observed emotional behavior; perception/understanding of others). The paper reports group-level, univariate whole-brain task-evoked contrasts (How>Why and Why>How) with tables of MNI coordinates and FDR-corrected results across the whole brain, satisfying the whole-brain evidence requirement. Healthy adult results are reported separately and are generalizable to the healthy group. Although connectivity (PPI) analyses are also included, they are supplemental to and do not replace the reported whole-brain activation maps. No exclusion criteria (ROI-only, resting-state-only, patient-only, non-empirical) apply. Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI study of social-related processing (social reflection: self- and other-judgments) in a healthy adult sample (n=22; ages within 17–65). The paper reports group-level, whole-brain task-evoked contrasts (SR > AL, S > AL, O > AL) with cortical surface maps, cluster-corrected results and Talairach coordinates (Tables/Figures). Although resting-state and ROI analyses are also included, whole-brain univariate task activation maps for the healthy group are clearly reported, satisfying all inclusion criteria and violating none of the exclusion criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an fMRI task study using a multiround trust game (social interaction) that includes a healthy adult control group (HC, n=21; ages 18–47). The paper reports whole-brain, voxelwise univariate analyses and displays group-level task activation maps for benevolence and malevolence for the healthy control group (voxelwise and cluster-level PFWE thresholds are provided). Results include within-group maps and whole-brain ANOVAs and regressions; findings for the HC group are reported separately and are generalizable to healthy adults. No exclusion criteria (ROI-only, connectivity-only, or lack of healthy-group whole-brain task maps) are violated.</p>

<p><strong>Fulltext Reasoning:</strong> This is an empirical fMRI study of joint attention (a social cognitive process) in healthy adult participants (n=65; mean age 22.4 years, right-handed, no neurological/psychiatric history). The paper reports group-level, whole-brain, univariate task-evoked analyses (GLM contrasts such as IJA, RJA, dIJA, dRJA, CTRL) with second-level random-effects results, cluster-level FWE correction, and anatomical labeling; whole-brain statistical maps and coordinate tables are described. The task is clearly social (joint attention/eye contact) and the results are generalizable to healthy adults. No exclusion criteria apply (not ROI-only, not resting-state-only, healthy adult group reported). Therefore the study meets all inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.</p>
