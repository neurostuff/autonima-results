It does not present functional MRI task activation results or a group-level, whole-brain task-evoked statistical map from healthy participants. A small subgroup previously participated in an earlier fMRI study, and the authors used SSC-BOLD responses from that prior work as a covariate in exploratory analyses, but this manuscript itself does not report healthy-group whole-brain fMRI activation maps or coordinates. Therefore it fails inclusion criteria I3 and I5 and must be excluded from a meta-analysis of fMRI task activations.

The abstract and highlights describe task-evoked BOLD (univariate) analyses as well as multivariate pattern analyses distinguishing cooperation and competition, indicating use of functional MRI during a social task (I3). The paper reports group-level univariate results (ToM regions recruited similarly across contexts), implying whole-brain task-evoked activation maps or voxelwise analyses typical for NeuroImage reports (I5). The population is adult participants (healthy adults) as is standard for this literature and no clinical group is indicated (I4). The manuscript also likely reports results as figures/tables of coordinates consistent with I6. No exclusion criteria (e.g., ROI-only, connectivity-only, non-empirical, or out-of-range age) are apparent from the provided full text.",

Given the publication norms and the journal, it is reasonable to infer that group-level, whole-brain task-evoked activations are reported (i.e., voxelwise contrasts) and likely presented in tables/figures, fulfilling the requirement that whole-brain results be available. Therefore the study appears to meet inclusion criteria for: I3 (social-related fMRI task), I4 (healthy adult participants), I5 (group-level whole-brain results), and I6 (whole-brain results likely reported in tables/figures). Confidence is moderate because the provided full-text content was not accessible in this prompt, so the inference is based on title, authorship, and journal context rather than direct inspection of methods/results.",

      "reason": "Although the study uses task-based fMRI of a social interaction (joint attention) and includes a healthy adult control group, the manuscript\u2019s primary reported results are cross-brain coupling (connectivity/ICA-based) and between-group comparisons. The full text does not present a clear, unmasked whole-brain, group-level task-evoked activation map (INT>NoINT) explicitly identified as coming from the healthy/control group (only group contrasts and null group differences are described). Therefore it fails the requirement for reporting a healthy-group whole-brain task activation (I5) and meets exclusion criterion E4 (reporting only between-group contrasts/interaction without an accompanying unmasked whole-brain healthy-group task effect).",

      "reason": "Although the study uses task-based fMRI of social cognition and includes a healthy adult control group, the full text (as provided) reports group comparisons (typically developing vs ASD) and ROI/contrast results (ASD < TD) but does not present or report an unmasked, whole-brain, group-level task activation map clearly identified as coming from the healthy/control group alone. The methods mention one-sample t-tests, but the published results only describe between-group contrasts and ROI analyses derived from those contrasts. Therefore this paper appears to lack the required healthy-group whole-brain task map (violation of E4).",
