Empathic accuracy tasks overcome these limitations by using autobiographical emotional video clips. Usually, a single measure of empathic accuracy is computed by correlating the participants&#x27; continuous ratings of the narrator&#x27;s emotional state with the narrator&#x27;s own ratings. 

In this study, we validated a modified empathic accuracy task. A valence-independent rating of the narrator&#x27;s emotional intensity was added to provide comparability between videos portraying different primary emotions and to explore changes in neural activity related to variations in emotional intensity over time. We also added a new neutral control condition to investigate general emotional processing. In the scanner, 34 healthy participants watched 6 video clips of people talking about an autobiographical event (2 sad, 2 happy and 2 neutral clips) while continuously rating the narrator&#x27;s emotional intensity. 

Fluctuation in perceived emotional intensity correlated with activity in brain regions previously implicated in cognitive empathy (bilateral superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction, and temporal pole) and affective empathy (right anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus). When emotional video clips were compared to neutral video clips, we observed higher activity in similar brain regions. Empathic accuracy, on the other hand, was only positively related to activation in regions that have been implicated in cognitive empathy. 

Our modified empathic accuracy task provides a new method for studying the underlying components and dynamic processes involved in empathy. While the task elicited both cognitive and affective empathy, successful tracking of others&#x27; emotions relied predominantly on the cognitive components of empathy. The fMRI data analysis techniques developed here may prove valuable in characterising the neural basis of empathic difficulties observed across a range of psychiatric conditions. 
   Highlights  
  
Activity in affective and cognitive empathy related regions during emotional videos. 
  
Activity in similar regions related to changes in perceived emotional intensity. 
  
Only regions implicated in cognitive empathy were associated with empathic accuracy. 
  
No difference between video clips that did and did not elicit affect sharing. 
  
Empathic accuracy related to self-rated perspective-taking but not empathic concern.</pre></details><details><summary>Body</summary><pre class="paper-text">## Introduction 
  
Empathy, has been defined as “an emotional response [… which] is similar to one&#x27;s perception […] and understanding […] of the stimulus emotion, with recognition that the source of the emotion is not one&#x27;s own.” ( , page 150). Empathy is crucial for successful social interaction as it allows the individual to predict others&#x27; actions, emotions and intentions ( ). Deficits in empathic processing have been reported in psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder ( ). Identifying the neural substrates of empathy in healthy populations is important for understanding conditions that are characterised by empathic difficulties. In neuroscience, the concept of empathy is considered to include separate affective (sharing others&#x27; emotion) and cognitive (understanding others&#x27; emotion) components (for example,  ;  ). Previous research has identified distinct clusters of brain regions involved in affective empathy: medial/anterior cingulate cortex (MCC, ACC), anterior insula (AI) ( ;  ), and supplementary motor area (SMA) ( ). Within the broader domain of social cognition, cognitive empathy overlaps with the affective component of Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalising, namely the capacity to infer other people&#x27;s thoughts, emotions and intentions without necessarily sharing them ( ). A recent meta-analysis of 144 fMRI studies using ToM tasks ( ) identified the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), ACC, precuneus, temporal pole (TP), posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as key regions for mentalising. 

However, prior research on the neural mechanisms of empathy has often lacked ecological validity. Studies have often used simplistic stimuli that differ greatly from the complex cues that individuals have to process in real-life situations ( ,  ). Moreover, most studies focus on empathy for pain, while only a few studies have evaluated other emotions (e.g. disgust, happiness, sadness;  ;  ). In addition, empathy has mostly been operationalised as a static trait ( ). However, in the real world empathy fluctuates dynamically ( ). These fluctuations can happen spontaneously because of changes in internal state or in response to shifts in external circumstances, such the emotional intensity and expressivity of others. 

In the current study, we addressed these limitations of previous research by modifying an existing paradigm, the Empathic Accuracy Task (EAT;  ), that incorporates more naturalistic stimuli and reflects the dynamic nature of empathy. Participants (perceivers) watch video clips in which another person (target) describes an emotional autobiographical event. Perceivers continuously rate the target&#x27;s emotion while watching the clips (via button pressing). The EAT measures how   accurately   the perceiver infers changes in the target&#x27;s emotional states by correlating the perceiver&#x27;s ratings with the target&#x27;s ratings of their own emotions (see   for a detailed description).   found that empathic accuracy was associated with higher activation in both affective (i.e. inferior parietal lobule (IPL)) and cognitive (i.e. mPFC) empathy networks. In a recent study of adolescents, empathic accuracy related positively to activation in cognitive empathy or mentalising regions (mPFC, TPJ, STS) and negatively to activation in regions implicated in affective empathy (IPL, ACC, AI;  ). 

In the current study, new video clips were created and the EAT was modified in the following important ways: First, video clips depicted discrete primary emotions (happy, sad, angry, frightened) and participants rated changes in the targets&#x27; emotional intensity (instead of valence) to ensure comparability across different emotions and higher construct validity. Second, we introduced well-matched neutral video clips that acted as a control condition. In this condition, targets described their bedroom. This control condition allowed us to examine the neural correlates of emotion processing irrespective of empathic accuracy. Third, as empathy is a dynamic process, perceivers need to be able to continuously identify changes in the intensity of the target&#x27;s emotional state. We therefore utilised an analysis approach that tracked changes in the target&#x27;s emotional intensity throughout each video clip, in addition to deriving a single index of empathic accuracy (averaged across the clip). Fourth, we included ratings from participants regarding how they felt after watching each video to gain a better understanding of how the neural correlates of EA are influenced by cognitive and affective empathy. Finally, to validate the EAT, we related task performance to self-reported trait empathy and IQ as well as acquiring a normative data set with participants who completed the EAT outside of the scanner. 

The aim of this study was to validate a modified version of the Empathic Accuracy Task, using a staged analysis approach which replicates analyses presented previously in the literature, but which also included additional comparisons. First, we contrasted the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses to emotional and neutral clips to explore correlates of complex and multi-sensory emotional processing during extended clips rather than single emotional images. Second, we validated our emotional intensity rating scale by analysing the neural correlates of intra-individual variations in empathic accuracy. Third, we explored neural correlations with variations in perceived emotional intensity over time, thus capitalising on the availability of continuous ratings throughout each video clip. 

Given the results of prior neuroimaging studies of empathy and mentalising, we had the following hypotheses:   
At the group level, increased BOLD responses would be observed in brain regions previously linked to empathy and mentalising when participants watched targets describe emotional versus neutral events. 
  
There would be positive correlations between intra-individual variations in empathic accuracy and BOLD responses in these regions. 
  
We predicted positive correlations between fluctuations in perceived emotional intensity and BOLD responses in these regions during emotional video clips. 
  


## Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
#### fMRI study 
  
Forty-seven healthy participants aged between 20 and 30 years, fluent in English and with no history of neurological illness, took part in the study. Six participants were excluded from the analysis due to current or recurrent episodes of mental illness as assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( ). Five further participants were excluded because of excessive head movement or poor task performance (&lt;2 SD in empathic accuracy (EA) scores) and two participants had incomplete questionnaire data. The final dataset included 34 subjects (19 females, mean age: 24.0 years, SD: 2.7 years). The study received ethical approval from the Camberwell - St. Giles NHS Research Ethics Committee (14/LO/0477) and the University of Southampton Ethics Committee. 


#### Normative data collection 
  
To create a normative data set for the EAT and to validate the stimuli used in the fMRI task, an additional 73 healthy participants completed the EAT outside the MRI scanner. The same inclusion criteria as described above were applied. After excluding 13 participants due to current or recurrent episodes of mental illness, the final dataset included 60 healthy participants (36 females, mean age: 25.2 years, SD: 2.9 years). This aspect of the study was approved by the University of Southampton Ethics Committee. 



### Tasks and stimuli 
  
#### Video acquisition 
  
Eleven native English-speaking students from the University of Southampton acted as targets (8 females, mean age: 20.1 years, SD: 1.64 years). Before filming they were asked to recall a specific autobiographical event (happy, sad, angry or frightened), in which they remembered feeling a strong emotion. Each target wrote a short summary of each event and rated its overall emotional intensity on a 9-point scale (from 1, ‘no emotion’ to 9, ‘very strong emotion’). For the emotional stimuli, only events with a rating of 5 or above were filmed. Each target provided one video clip for each emotion and one clip in which they described their bedroom (neutral condition). An adapted emotion elicitation strategy, which involved imagining being in the situation, was used before filming to reinstate the affective states the targets had felt during the events ( ). They were advised to refrain from making specific reference to their affective state (e.g. happy) but were allowed to use generic descriptions (e.g. upset) or descriptions of bodily symptoms (e.g. shaking). All targets were filmed from the shoulders upwards, in front of a black background, for standardisation purposes. Each clip lasted between 83 and 140 s (mean = 100.3, SD = 15.2). After filming each clip, targets watched the video and continuously rated their emotional intensity using the same 9-point scale as above. Ratings were made by using arrow keys on the keyboard to move a coloured square on the scale (this shifted by one point per button press). Starting point for all ratings was “1”. 

For the fMRI study, the 6 video clips that were selected (one happy, one sad and one neutral video, featuring one female and one male target) were those which received high EA and target expressiveness scores in a pilot study with 13 participants (7 male, mean age: 21.54 years, SD: 2.37 years). A description of the target&#x27;s gender, the emotional condition, the clip length and the target&#x27;s rating of emotional intensity experienced during each clip is presented in  . For pre-training and volume adjustment, one additional sad, one neutral and two happy clips were added (depicting different targets from the main experiment). For the data collection outside the MRI scanner, 27 expressive video clips were selected (7 happy clips, 7 sad clips, 3 angry clips, 3 frightened clips and 7 neutral clips) as well as two happy clips and one sad clip for pre-training purposes. The task and instructions for filming stimuli are available on request.

#### Empathic accuracy task (EAT) 
  
Participants were instructed to continuously rate the perceived emotional intensity of the target ( , top) using the same 9-point scale as above (from 1, ‘no emotion’ to 9, ‘very strong emotion’). In the fMRI study, participants used a button box to provide ratings. In the non-imaging study, participants used the computer&#x27;s arrow keys. The default rating at the start of each video clip was no emotion (i.e. rating of 1). Following each clip, participants were asked: (1) which emotion the target felt most strongly (cognitive empathy: options of “happy”, “angry”, “surprised”, “sad”, “frightened” and “no emotion”); and (2) which emotion they themselves felt most strongly (i.e., affective empathy: same response options as above).

#### Interpersonal reactivity index 
  
The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is a widely-used self-report questionnaire that measures dispositional empathy using four subscales: fantasy (FS), empathic concern (EC), perspective taking (PT) and personal distress (PD;  ).

The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II;  ) is a widely-used and reliable test of general intelligence. 



### Procedure 
  
#### fMRI study 
  
The EAT was part of the testing protocol of the English and Romanian Adoptees&#x27; Brain Imaging Study (for further details, see  ). Participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. All participants completed the MINI and WASI-II, and an online survey, which included the IRI. Participants received pre-training on the fMRI tasks prior to the scan, during which they were familiarised with the EAT and the scanning environment. After observing the experimenter demonstrating how to rate one happy clip, participants rated two clips (one sad, one happy) themselves, while lying in a mock scanner. In the actual EAT experiment, participants watched and rated the 6 video clips in a fixed order ( ). The task took approximately 12 min. Participants were reimbursed for around 6 h of their time with a £100 Amazon voucher. 


#### Normative data collection 
  
For the non-scanning study, participants gave written consent to participate. For pre-training, participants first watched the experimenter rate one happy clip before rating two practice video clips themselves. They then watched and rated 27 video clips in randomised presentation order, in a quiet testing room. This lasted approximately 40 min. Participants also completed an online survey, which included the IRI. Participants were reimbursed for their time with a £15 Amazon voucher. 



### Behavioural data analysis 
  
Participants&#x27; and targets&#x27; ratings were analysed using Matlab 8.2.0 (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) and SPSS (Version 22, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). All ratings were separated into 2 s bins and one time-weighted average rating was calculated for each bin. We then tested for correlations between the participants&#x27; and targets&#x27; ratings ( , bottom). The resulting Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient for each video clip and each participant is referred to as the EA score. As expected, the variance of the ratings was low for neutral clips. EA scores were therefore only calculated for emotional video clips. EA scores were then r-to-Z transformed to allow comparison between correlation coefficients ( ,  ). 

#### Behavioural analysis of fMRI sample 
  
Paired t-tests examined whether Z-transformed EA scores, affective and cognitive empathy scores differed between happy and sad video clips. Moreover, paired t-tests were performed to test for differences in the average ratings of the target&#x27;s emotional intensity between emotional and neutral as well as happy and sad video clips. A paired   t  -test was also used to test whether Z-EA scores differed between video clips that elicited “affect sharing” (participants reported feeling the same emotion as the target) compared to those that did not (participants reported a different emotion or no emotion). In addition, Pearson correlations were conducted to test for relationships between mean Z-EA scores, the IRI subscales and IQ. 


#### Behavioural analysis of normative data sample 
  
To examine whether the video clips presented in the fMRI study induced Z-EA scores comparable to those in the non-scanning sessions, two Pearson correlations were performed within the normative data sample. Considering happy and sad video clips separately, we examined the correlation between Z-EA scores based on the two video clips presented in the scanner and Z-EA scores based on all seven video clips from the respective emotional category. Moreover, intra-individual standard deviations were calculated based on (1) the four emotional video clips presented in the scanner and (2) all 20 emotional video clips. These were then compared with a paired   t  -test. 



### fMRI data acquisition 
  
Functional images were acquired on a General Electric MR750 3.0 T MR scanner with a 12-channel head coil. A T2*-weighted gradient echo, echo-planar imaging sequence was used, which covered 41 axial slices and recorded 347 vol acquired sequentially, descending (TR/TE 2000/30 ms, flip angle 75°, 64 × 64 matrix, 3 mm thick, field of view (FoV) = 247 mm). To facilitate fMRI data registration and normalisation, we also acquired a T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo MPRAGE image (TR/TE 7312/3.02 ms, flip angle 11°, 256 × 256 matrix, 1.2 mm thick, 196 sagittal slices, FoV = 270 mm). 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
We used SPM12 for pre-processing and subject-level (first level) analyses (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute for Neurology, London, UK). FSL was utilised for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regression and statistical nonparametric permutation inference at the group level (second level) with “randomise” ( ; FMRIB Analysis Research, Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). 

#### Preprocessing 
  
After reorientation, the EPI files were first slice-time corrected (middle slice as reference). Images were then realigned to the first image and subsequently to the time series mean. The mean EPI image was co-registered to the T1-weighted image to allow for normalisation. The structural files were segmented and the resulting grey matter, white matter and CSF files were used to create a common group-specific template using group-wise DARTEL registration ( ). This template was then employed to normalise the functional EPI files to MNI space. This step simultaneously resampled volumes (1.5 mm isotropic) and applied spatial smoothing (Gaussian FWHM kernel of 8 mm). Finally, for each participant, the time course signal of a CSF mask (top 5% from DARTEL CSF component) was extracted in native space. 


#### Emotional vs neutral video clips 
  
At the first level of analysis, each participant&#x27;s pre-processed data were modelled as a block design using a general linear model framework. We included 3 separate regressors (happy, sad, neutral) encoding the predicted BOLD response associated with video presentation, formed by convolution of the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) with boxcars delimiting the video presentation. 

We identified regional estimates of BOLD response associated with watching and rating the video clips. Separate parameter estimates for mean response during the emotional (happy and sad) and neutral category compared to the implicit baseline were produced. At the group level, in a random-effects model, paired t-tests were performed to identify clusters that were differentially activated when watching emotional video clips compared to neutral clips. Moreover, happy and sad clips were compared using paired t-tests. 


#### Intra-individual variation in empathic accuracy 
  
In accordance with  , Z-EA scores for each participant and each video clip were added as parametric modulators at the first level of analysis. On the group level, one sample t-tests were performed, to test whether the BOLD response during emotional video clips was modulated by intra-individual variations in Z-EA scores. 


#### Correlation with emotional intensity ratings 
  
We examined how the BOLD time series correlated with the participant&#x27;s ratings of the target&#x27;s emotional intensity. Scans were split and a model was fitted to each emotional video clip in turn. The continuous ratings of the target&#x27;s emotional intensity for each 2 s bin as rated by the participant were entered as regressors of interest. At the group level, one-sample t-tests assessed whether the relationship between BOLD response and changes in the emotional intensity ratings was significantly observed in any brain region across the group. 


#### Exploratory analysis: impact of affect sharing 
  
To examine differences in BOLD response for video clips that induced affect sharing compared to those that did not, we conducted an exploratory post-hoc analysis. We included the 20 participants who showed affect sharing in response to some, but not all video clips in order to be able to create 3 separate conditions in the first level in a block design (shared, non-shared, neutral). For each participant, emotional videos that induced affect sharing (participants reported to have the same emotion as the target) were included in the shared condition, while emotional videos that did not elicit affect sharing (participants reported to have a different emotion than the target or no emotion) were modelled in the non-shared condition. Separate parameter estimates for mean response during affect shared, non-shared and neutral video clip presentation compared to the implicit baseline were calculated. At the group level, paired t-tests were performed to identify clusters that were differentially activated when watching video clips that induced affect sharing compared to non-shared clips. 


#### Movement, scanner drifts and multiple comparisons correction 
  
As well as the regressors described above, all analyses included seven movement parameters (six standard parameters as well as volume-to-volume movement) as nuisance regressors. For each volume-to-volume movement exceeding 1 mm, an additional regressor was included marking the location of that volume and those immediately adjacent (for a summary of volume-to-volume movement see  ). The CSF regressor was also included as a nuisance regressor. To control for task-related hand movement artefacts, button presses were included as condition of no interest. To investigate the effect of controlling for button presses, we additionally repeated all analyses without including this condition. Moreover, we compared button presses during emotional video clips with button presses during neutral video clips as separate conditions to ensure that activity relating to emotion processing was not partialled out. 

Data were high pass filtered with a threshold of 209 s, which corresponds to twice the length of the longest video clip, to control for scanner drifts. 

Results reported are based on Family-Wise Error (FWE) corrected threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE:   p   &lt; 0.05 ( )). For each significant cluster, the peak activations with a minimum inter-peak distance of 20 voxels are reported to account for the wide-spanning clusters found in our analyses. 




## Results 
  
### Behavioural data 
  
#### Behavioural analysis of the fMRI sample 
  
On average, participants had high EA scores (mean   r   = .75, mean intra-individual standard deviation (iSD) = .35, range = .13 to .97). Fisher&#x27;s Z-transformed (Z-)EA scores were slightly, but significantly, lower for sad video clips (mean Z-EA = 0.97, SD = 0.21) than happy ones (mean Z-EA = 1.16, SD = 0.19;   t   (33) = 5.17,   p   &lt; .001). As expected, participants&#x27; average ratings of the target&#x27;s emotional intensity were higher for emotional than for neutral video clips (mean emotional = 5.18, mean neutral = 1.75,   t   (33) = 15.29,   p   &lt; .001), with higher ratings for sad compared to happy ones (mean sad = 5.49, mean happy = 4.87,   t   (33) = 3.02,   p   &lt; .01). 

On average, participants correctly inferred the target&#x27;s emotion in 90.4% of clips (emotion identification, SD = 15.1%), with no difference between happy and sad clips (  t   (33) = −0.33,   p   = .74). They also reported experiencing the same emotion as the target for the majority of the emotional video clips (affect sharing, mean = 72.8%, SD = 28.5%), with a higher degree concordance for sad (mean = 79.4%, SD = 32.8%) compared to happy clips (mean = 66.2%, SD = 31.9%;   t   (33) = 2.5,   p   &lt; .05). 13 participants shared the target&#x27;s emotion in every emotional video clip while one participant did not show affect sharing in any of the clips. For the remaining 20 participants who showed a mix of affect sharing and non-sharing, Z-EA scores did not differ for videos that elicited affect sharing (mean Z-EA = 1.09, SD = .24) compared to those that did not (mean Z-EA = 1.06, SD = .33,   t   (19) = .36,   p   = .72). 

Additionally, we found a positive correlation between participants&#x27; mean Z-EA scores and IRI perspective-taking (  r   = .48,   p   &lt; .01). No significant correlations were found between mean Z-EA scores and the other IRI subscales or estimated IQ (all   ps   &gt; .09). 

Note that while we used Pearson&#x27;s product-moment correlation, alternative methods for assessing agreement are available such as the intraclass correlation coefficient. EA scores derived using this measure were highly correlated (r = 0.89) with Pearson&#x27;s correlations. We chose the latter for two reasons. First, we were able to confirm our findings after partialling out dependency over time of the ratings (data not shown) and second, we wished to maintain compatibility with previous studies using similar tasks that also based estimates of inter-rater agreement on Pearson&#x27;s correlations. 


#### Behavioural analysis of the normative data sample 
  
The analysis showed that the mean Z-EA scores for the video clips presented in the fMRI study were strongly positively correlated with Z-EA scores for the seven clips presented in the normative data study (happy:   r   = .82,   p   &lt; .001; sad:   r   = .77,   p   &lt; .001). Furthermore, the intra-individual standard deviation of the four emotional video clips presented in the scanner (mean iSD = .36) did not differ from the individual standard deviation across all 20 emotional video clips presented outside the scanner (mean iSD = .39,   t   (59) = −1.64,   p   = .11). 



### fMRI data 
  
#### Emotional vs. neutral video clips 
  
Group-level analysis revealed a higher BOLD response during emotional compared to neutral clips in a large cluster spanning multiple regions, with peak activations in bilateral occipital poles and inferior lateral occipital cortex ( a,  ). The cluster included bilateral posterior and anterior superior temporal cortex (STC), as well as bilateral temporal pole (TP), bilateral planum temporale and bilateral posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ). Higher activation was also seen in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; including pars triangularis and opercularis), with the cluster extending into right anterior insular cortex (AI) and right putamen. A second cluster showed higher activation in supplementary motor area (SMA). While participants were watching neutral compared to emotional video clips, activation was higher in left superior lateral occipital cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and left precuneus. Significant activation was similar, albeit more widespread, when not controlling for button presses (see  ). Moreover, when analysing the button press condition separately for emotional and neutral video clips, no brain regions showed significant differences between both button press conditions.

To explore differences between the different emotion conditions, we also directly compared happy and sad video clips. Activation in the bilateral STC was higher during happy compared to sad clips, while the right paracingulate gyrus and right precuneus showed higher activation during sad video clips (see   and  ). 


#### Intra-individual variation in empathic accuracy 
  
Participants&#x27; intra-individual variations in Z-EA scores were positively related to activation in clusters spanning the bilateral STC, planum temporale, TP and pTPJ, left hippocampus and left amygdala. Activity in the bilateral inferior lateral occipital cortex and fusiform cortex was also positively related to Z-EA scores ( b,  ). Activation in the bilateral paracingulate gyrus and right frontal pole as well as the right middle frontal gyrus was significantly negatively modulated by Z-EA scores.

#### Correlation with emotional intensity ratings 
  
While watching emotional video clips, participants&#x27; fluctuations in ratings of the targets&#x27; emotional intensity were positively correlated over time with changes in BOLD response in multiple brain regions ( c,  ). Associations were found in multiple clusters including bilateral posterior STC, bilateral TP, bilateral IFG (including pars triangularis and opercularis), bilateral SMA, bilateral middle and superior frontal cortices, right anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), right AI, bilateral amygdala, bilateral putamen as well as pTPJ and right temporal occipital and anterior temporal fusiform cortex. Emotional intensity ratings and BOLD-response were negatively correlated in the in the bilateral superior lateral occipital cortex, PCC, and precuneus.   shows a binarised overlay of significant clusters in the different analyses.

#### Exploratory analysis: impact of affect sharing 
  
For emotional video clips, there were no significant differences in BOLD response between clips that elicited, versus those that did not elicit, affect sharing (i.e. participants reported experiencing the same emotion as the target after providing their continuous ratings). 




## Discussion 
  
We used a modified version of the EAT to study neural substrates of empathic accuracy and to gain a better understanding of its underlying components. We demonstrated that fluctuations in participants&#x27; perceived emotional intensity ratings are correlated with activation in a network of brain regions previously implicated in empathy and broader aspects of social cognition (i.e., mentalising). More specifically, consistent with our first hypothesis, we observed increased activation in brain regions associated with empathy and mentalising when participants watched emotional compared to neutral clips. Supporting our second hypothesis, we found a positive correlation between intra-individual variations in empathic accuracy and the temporal lobe, “mentalising” regions of the same network. Confirming our third hypothesis, we found a correlation between fluctuations in ratings of the targets&#x27; perceived emotional intensity over time and activity in these same regions. This network of brain regions appears not only to have a general role in emotion and empathic processing but is also sensitive to   variations   in the intensity of others&#x27; emotions. 

The superior temporal sulcus (STS), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and temporal pole (TP) have consistently been associated with mentalising ( ). In our study, these areas were more active with higher EA, i.e. when participants were more accurate at tracking the target&#x27;s emotion. Beyond this, we could also show these regions are sensitive to fluctuations in perceived emotional intensity of others. The STS is thought to facilitate mentalising by interpreting social aspects of observed biological motion ( ,  ) and the region has been implicated in EA ( ,  ). The TPJ is involved in inferring other people&#x27;s temporary mental states ( ) while the TP&#x27;s role in mentalising is thought to involve the integration of multimodal information and recollection of social scripts ( ;  ). Combined, these brain regions are involved in distinct emotional and cognitive processes that are required to perform our modified EAT: they are integral for the successful tracking of others&#x27; emotional intensity and correlate positively with intra-individual variations in EA. 

The anterior insula (AI), anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and supplementary motor area (SMA) have previously been implicated in empathy tasks and are associated with the affect sharing component of empathy (or affective empathy) ( ). Together these regions are implicated in the emotional processing of the modified EAT stimuli. Most importantly, we could show for the first time that their activity tracks the perceived emotional intensity of others. However, activity in these brain regions was not sensitive to changes in EA and thus seems more tied to the subjective perception of other&#x27;s feelings. 

This suggests it is the time-series variation in activation in the temporal lobe regions (STS, TPJ, TP) that might be informative for accurately tracking other people&#x27;s emotions, while activation in the frontal regions (AI, ACC, IFG, SMA) represents a different emotion processing component that does not vary with changes in EA ( ). This is consistent with previous studies on EA, which showed either no correlation between EA and activity in the above frontal regions ( ) or, in the case of adolescents, a negative correlation between EA and ACC and AI activation ( ). Furthermore, we could not replicate an association between EA and activity in the inferior parietal lobe, a region implicated in motor imitation and previously interpreted as an affective processing component of EA ( ). Taken together, these findings provide evidence that EA is more closely related to the concept of cognitive empathy and mentalising than affective empathy and emotion sharing. The role of EA in cognitive but not affective empathy is further supported by the positive correlation between EA scores and the perspective-taking scale of a well-established self-report measure of empathy (the IRI) but not with other more affective subscales such as empathic concern. Moreover, participants&#x27; average EA scores did not differ between videos where they shared the same emotion as the target compared to those were they did not, which again suggests that emotion sharing is neither necessary for, nor facilitates, EA. 

Even if EA does only relate to cognitive but not affective empathy, the EAT as a task successfully elicited affective empathy in most of our participants – they reported sharing the target&#x27;s emotion in 73% of the emotional video clips. However, there were no significant differences in brain activity when rating videos where participants shared the same emotion compared to videos where they did not. This further supports our hypothesis that the higher activation in aMCC, AI, SMA and IFG during emotional clips is associated with more basal, empathy-independent aspects of emotion processing. 

Higher activation of the bilateral STS could also be seen during happy compared to sad video clips, while the right paracingulate gyrus was more highly activated during sad video clips. This is in line with our behavioural findings of, on average, higher EA scores during happy video clips, which suggest more successful tracking and mentalising of the target&#x27;s emotion, while sad video clips induced higher rates of affect sharing among participants. The paracingulate gyrus has previously been implicated in affective empathy ( ). 

During the modified EAT, participants rated fluctuations in emotional intensity rather than valence as this allowed a comparable rating scale across different distinct emotions. Furthermore, previous literature suggests distinct neural correlates for processing emotional intensity and valence ( ), with the amygdala being associated with intensity and the orbitofrontal cortex with valence. In agreement with this, we found that bilateral activation of amygdala but not the orbitofrontal cortex covaried with the emotional intensity of the targets. Unexpectedly activation in the precuneus – a region implicated in self-referential processing ( ) – was stronger during neutral versus emotional clips and correlated negatively with emotional intensity ratings. The precuneus is associated with visual-spatial imagery ( ,  ) and is a component of the default mode network ( ). Higher activation during the neutral videos in which participants described their bedroom, might be explained by higher visual-spatial imagery and an increased tendency for mind-wandering during these less engaging parts of the task ( ). 

Empathy is a complex and dynamic process, which requires multiple higher order functions ( ) such as emotion recognition, multimodal sensory integration, self-other distinction and continuous processing of valence and intensity information. Compared to other commonly used empathy tasks, the modified EAT used a more naturalistic setting to examine which brain regions track fluctuations over time in perceived emotional intensity of others and intra-individual variations in empathic accuracy. Previous studies in the empathy and mentalising literature have largely focused on simplistic stimuli (e.g. static images of hands in painful situations). Compared to these earlier studies, we found that regions that have been separately implicated in mentalising and empathy were all involved in performing the modified EAT. However, only brain regions previously associated with mentalising were found to covary with EA, while regions previously implicated in classic affective empathy paradigms were positively correlated with the emotional intensity of others but were not sensitive to changes in EA. In this more naturalistic and complex task, it seems that an interplay between brain networks associated with mentalising and empathy enables the accurate tracking of other&#x27;s emotions. Furthermore, these regions were sensitive to fluctuations in perceived emotional intensity of others, which serves as a potential mechanism for successful communication between these networks to achieve empathic accuracy. 

A possible limitation of our study was the lower number of emotional video clips in comparison to previous studies on EA ( ,  ). This study was conducted within the framework of a larger project, and thus the scanning time was limited. However, we showed that our chosen video clips led to very similar EA scores relative to those obtained with the larger dataset of 27 video clips in the norm sample. More importantly, the intra-individual variation across videos was also comparable to that seen for the full set of video clips. 

The study had a number of strengths. The original EAT ( ) represented an important advance in empathy research, as it was the first task to utilise naturalistic stimuli and assess EA in an fMRI context. In this modified EAT, the stimuli used for fMRI purposes had been validated in a separate behavioural study. Moreover, we added a neutral control condition, which allowed us to identify brain regions that are generally more active during emotional video clips irrespective of empathic accuracy. Future studies could employ this paradigm to study psychiatric populations with empathy deficits (e.g., adolescents with Conduct Disorder;  ). By additionally taking the neutral control condition into account, one could examine whether emotional clips were ‘neutral-like’ in those with low EA scores. For future studies, it would be worth considering incorporating neutral videos with varying topics other than bedroom descriptions to ensure continued engagement throughout the task (see   for possible examples). Furthermore, we introduced the measurement of emotional intensity rather than valence, which is more closely related to the concept of empathy. This also made the video clips of different emotions comparable and allowed a more fine-grained analysis of changes over time in activation related to the emotional intensity of others. Together, we propose that the three analysis techniques used in this study, should be employed in conjunction to allow a comprehensive study of empathic accuracy and its different components. 

In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that the modified EAT is a suitable paradigm for studying empathy and its underlying components. We show that, while the modified EAT successfully induces both affective and cognitive empathy, EA relies more on cognitive empathy than affect sharing. The neutral control condition and the valence-independent rating scale represent valuable additions to the task. The fMRI data analysis techniques developed and described here may prove valuable in characterising differences between healthy participants and participants with psychiatric conditions associated with empathy deficits.

A number of neuroimaging studies have examined the brain networks for leading and following, but none have examined what effect prior expertise at these roles has on brain activations during joint motor tasks. Couple dancers (e.g., dancers of Tango, Salsa, and swing) are an ideal population in which examine such effects, since leaders and followers of partnered dances have similar overall levels of motor expertise at dancing, but can differ strikingly in their role-specific skill sets. To explore role-specific expertise effects on brain activations for the first time, we recruited nine skilled leaders and nine skilled followers of couple dances for a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We employed a two-person scanning arrangement that allowed a more naturalistic interaction between two individuals. The dancers interacted physically with an experimenter standing next to the bore of the magnet so as to permit bimanual partnered movements. Together, they alternated between leading and following the joint movements. The results demonstrated that the brain activations during the acts of leading and following were enhanced by prior expertise at being a leader or follower, and that activity in task-specific brain areas tended to be positively correlated with the level of expertise at the corresponding role. These findings provide preliminary evidence that training at one role of a joint motor task can selectively enhance role-related brain activations.</pre></details><details><summary>Body</summary><pre class="paper-text">## Introduction 
  
Much joint action between two people involves the contrastive roles of leader and follower ( ). For example, when two people move a sofa, the front person is often the one who navigates the joint movement as well as the one who determines the speed at which the two people move, while the back person responds to these movement-cues and attempts to coordinate his/her actions with the front person. However, the experimental literature that examines joint action in the lab does not give consideration to individual differences, for example the fact that people may be predisposed toward being a leader or follower based on their personality traits or life experiences ( ). In typical studies of joint action, people are randomly assigned to being a leader or follower (or both) of a joint task without assessing individual differences in task expertise that may exist between them. This applies to studies of both experts ( ;  ) and non-experts ( ;  ;  ;  ). This may be problematic since many studies demonstrate that expertise has an effect on behavioral performance and brain activations across many domains ( ;  ;  ). 

An interesting solution to this problem is to examine couple dancers, such as Tango dancers, since such people engage in extensive training to develop expertise at one specific role in the dance, thereby making the assessment of leading/following experience on joint action quite feasible. Leaders and followers of a couple dance have similar overall levels of motor expertise at dancing, but they can differ strikingly in their role-specific skill sets, such that dancers of one role are often unable to dance the opposite role. This applies not merely to the movement patterns themselves, but to the   coordination   skills required for leading (e.g., force conveyance) and following (e.g., responsiveness to force cues). While previous neuroimaging studies have looked separately at the topics of leading/following and expertise, the current study–which is a follow-up analysis to a previously published study from our lab ( )–represents a first attempt at examining   role-specific expertise   at leading and following, doing so using trained leaders and followers of couple dances. The principal aim of the study is to identify role-specific brain activations, namely leading-related activations in trained leaders compared to non-leaders, and following-related activations in trained followers compared to non-followers. 

Previous studies of leading and following have tended to emphasize the networks for leading, more so than those for following. For example, studies of interactive imitation have compared the initiation and imitation of visual actions within the same group of participants, and have highlighted an initiation network involved in self-monitoring, willed action, and decision making ( ;  ;  ;  ). Studies of auditory-entrainment tasks, such as finger tapping, have studied expert leaders or individuals who spontaneously emerge as leaders with in the context of the study, and have similarly identified a network involved in decision making, movement initiation, and self-processing ( ;  ;  ). These studies have provided either no results or inconsistent findings regarding following or expert followers. In a previous publication from our lab ( ), we characterized the networks for leading and following during a joint-action task with physical interaction, using the same dancer participants as those employed in the present study. In accordance with the previous literature, we found that leading showed a motor- and self-oriented profile, engaging areas associated with motor planning, spatial navigation, sequencing, action monitoring, and error correction. In contrast, following showed a far more sensory- and externally oriented profile, revealing areas involved in somatosensation, proprioception, motion tracking, social cognition, and outcome monitoring. However, while that study compared the act of leading with the act of following, it did not assess the influence of prior expertise at being a leader or follower on the brain activations. That was the major objective of the current follow-up analysis, namely to examine role-specific expertise. 

It is well-established that expertise can influence both the structure and function of the brain. There is now a vast literature devoted to various forms of motor, perceptual, and cognitive expertise (reviewed in  ). A general finding of such studies is that brain activations and gray matter volume are enhanced in experts, as compared to non-experts, in areas that process the skills that underlie a person’s domain of expertise ( ;  ;  ). For example, with regard to perceptual tasks, trained musicians and other auditory experts show enhanced effects in auditory cortex ( ,  ;  ;  ), while visual experts show effects in visual cortex ( ,  ;  ). In the motor domain, effects are found in cortical and subcortical motor and premotor areas involved in motor execution, control, planning, and representation ( ;  ). Motor experts, such as athletes, dancers, and musicians, additionally demonstrate changes in perceptual and cognitive areas associated with their trained skills ( ). For example, sensorimotor coupling is enhanced in musicians and athletes ( ;  ). In addition, activations in the action-observation network [including premotor cortex (PMC), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL)] are enhanced when dancers view specific dance patterns that they are expert in ( ), or when athletes view sports actions that they are expert in ( ), as compared to when the same people view dances or sports movements that they are not trained in.   suggested that this effect was due to motor training, rather than the associated perceptual training. Expertise, in addition to producing enhancements in processing, has also been linked to decreases in the overall number of activated foci in neuroimaging studies, especially in attentional and cognitive-control networks, suggesting an enhancement in automaticity of processing for the trained skill ( ;  ). The “two stage expertise hypothesis” ( ;  ) suggests that short-term training leads to enhancements of brain activations for the trained skill, while long-term training and skill mastering lead instead to decreases or reorganizations in brain activations. 

While previous neuroimaging studies have looked at leading/following and expertise in isolation, no study thus far has combined the two issues, which is the principal objective of the present study. As mentioned above, couple dancers are an ideal cohort for exploring role-specific expertise in leading and following, since they spend many years developing expertise at typically just one of the two roles of the dance. As a result, expert leaders are usually unskilled followers, and vice versa, while both groups have comparable levels of overall motor expertise at the dance. More specifically, leader expertise during couple dancing requires the generation of a motor plan for both the self and the partner, and the efficient conveyance of signals to the partner, while follower expertise requires the tracking of information coming from the leader and its interpretation to construct either an identical or complementary movement pattern in real time. 

In order to assess the effect of role expertise on brain activations during an ecologically valid joint-action task, we carried out an exploratory follow-up analysis to our previous publication that looked at leading and following ( ) in order to examine the effects of role-specific expertise on brain activations. In the previous study, skilled leaders and followers of couple dances performed both a leading and following task in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in interaction with an experimenter standing next to the bore of the magnet. The participant and experimenter were in physical contact at their hands, and alternated between being the leader and follower of joint improvised bimanual movements. The principal aim of the study was to compare brain activity during the acts of leading and following. The current study follows up on those results using the same dataset in order to examine the effects of individual differences on the brain activations, in particular an individual’s expertise at a given role of the dance. The aim was to look for role-specific brain activations, in other words leading-related activations in trained leaders compared to non-leaders (i.e., followers), and following-related activations in trained followers compared to non-followers (i.e., leaders). Based on the literature cited above demonstrating that experts show enhancements in task-specific brain areas compared to non-experts when performing the same tasks, we predicted that leaders, as compared with non-leaders, would show an enhancement of leading-related activations when leading (only), and likewise that followers, as compared with non-followers, would show an enhancement of following-related activations when following (only). Given that we were not able to effectively rule out the influence of gender on dance role in our design, the results need to be viewed as exploratory. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Eighteen participants (nine of each gender) took part in this study after giving their written informed consent in accordance with the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, who approved the study (St. Joseph’s Healthcare, R. P. #12-3777). They received monetary compensation for their participation. None of them had a past history of neurological or psychiatric disease. An inclusion criterion for the study was that participants have at least 2 years of experience at one or more kinds of couple dances involving leading and following (e.g., Argentine Tango, Salsa, Swing, and Ballroom). Male participants (40.7 ± 14.9 years old) had a mean dance experience of 8.7 ± 7.2 years, principally as leaders, although one male had significant experience as a follower as well. Female participants (40.2 ± 12.3 years old) had a mean dance experience of 5.6 ± 2.9 years, principally as followers, although two females had significant experience as leaders as well. 

On the day of the experiment, participants reported their ability to lead or follow a couple dance using a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to no expertise at leading or following, and 100 corresponds to a very high level of expertise at leading or following. Each person did separate ratings for leading and following skill, with results shown in   Figure   . We explained to participants that these scales emphasized the ability to transmit/receive information while dancing with a partner, rather than the ability to perform complex or stylistic movements. Males reported a mean leading ability of 69.8 ± 17.7 (one male was at 35 and the rest ranged from 60 to 90). Likewise, females reported a mean following ability of 77.2 ± 8.3 (ranging from 70 to 90). With regards to the complementary skill, males reported a mean following ability of 33.7 ± 21.6; the male with significant following experience reported his following ability at 78, while all the others males rated it at between 8 and 50. Females reported a mean leading ability of 28.9 ± 25.2; both females with significant leading experience reported their leading ability at 70, while all other females rated themselves at between 5 and 40. Correlations between leading ability, following ability, years of experience at dancing, and age showed that leading ability, but not following ability, correlated with the number of years of experience (  Table   ). Anecdotal evidence suggests that leading skill requires a greater amount of time and effort to achieve than does following skill, which may explain the exclusive correlation of leading skill with years of experience. Since leading and following ability were not anti-correlated in the analysis, participants designated as “leaders” in this study were comprised of all the participants who were primarily trained as leaders for at least 2 years (i.e., all the of males) plus the two participants who, although primarily trained as followers, had significant leading experience and a strong leading ability (two females). Those designated as “followers” were comprised of all the participants who were primarily trained as followers for at least 2 years (i.e., all of the females) plus one participant who, although primarily trained as leader, had significant following experience and a strong following ability (one male). Thus, three participants belonged in both groups. This division was used in only the first set of analyses (see below).

The   x  -axis shows the self-rating scale for leader skill (left panel) and follower skill (right panel) for couple dancing, where 100 is the highest rating. The   y  -axis of each graph shows the number of participants, from the pool of 18, who rated themselves at the various levels of skill for each role. Female participants are color-coded red and males are color-coded blue, both here and in   Figures  ,   . Participants designated as “leaders” in this study were comprised of all the males plus the two females with strong leading ability, while those designated as “followers” were comprised of all the females plus the male with strong following ability. Leaders are color coded as purple here and in   Figures  –  , whereas followers are color coded as pink here and in   Figures  –   (not to be confused with the color coding of gender).

### Procedure 
  
While the participant was lying supine in the MRI scanner, an experimenter (LASC) stood next to the bore of the scanner in order to have physical contact with the participant’s two hands. The participant’s forearms were fastened to the side of their body such that only their wrists, hands and fingers were able to move. Participants’ hands (palms up) were always below the experimenter’s hands (palms down), so that the participants’ hands could not be passively moved. The experimenter had significant experience both as a follower and a leader of couple dances. Together, the participant and experimenter performed highly controlled joint hand movements in all three planes of motion, alternating between leading and following the joint movement during different task-epochs of the scan. The movement patterns were improvised, rather than pre-learned, in order to maintain an ongoing requirement for motor planning during leading and a comparably heightened sense of responsiveness during following. No external cuing of tempo or rhythm was done with a metronome or with music. Participants performed all conditions with their eyes closed, and were instructed about which task to perform by means of pre-recorded verbal cues delivered through MRI-compatible headphones. Each condition was performed in a random order six times in blocks of 28 s. 

Complete methods and details concerning fMRI acquisition and image analysis, including participant training, are described in  . Briefly, the functional MRI imaging parameters were 2000 ms TR, 35 ms TE, 90° flip angle, 39 axial slices, 4 mm slice thickness, 0 mm gap, 3.75 × 3.75 mm in-plane resolution, 64 × 64 matrix, and 240 mm field of view. An automatic shimming procedure was performed before each scan to minimize inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field. For each of the three functional scans, 216 volumes–corresponding to 12 epochs of 28 s task + 8 s rest–were collected over 7’12”, resulting in a total of 648 volumes. Two magnetic field maps (5 ms then 8 ms TE) with the same imaging parameters as the fMRI were acquired in order to unwarp the data. Unwarping was performed with the relaxation method of “anatabacus”, a plugin in BrainVoyager, in order to correct for non-rigid deformations. In addition, the head-motion parameters were included as nuisance regressors in the analysis. Functional and structural images were processed using BrainVoyager QX 2.8. Coordinate tables were computed using NeuroElf. 


### Analysis 
  
We first performed qualitative analyses on three groups to assess if there were any differences between being a leader and being a follower. Specifically, we carried out three random-effects analyses for the bidirectional contrast “Leading versus Following” (1) for the whole group of 18 participants, (2) for the 11 leaders only, and (3) for the 10 followers only. These were performed at a two-tailed statistical threshold of   p   &lt; 0.005 uncorrected with a cluster-level correction of   k   = 28 voxels determined with Alphasim (family-wise error   p   &lt; 0.05) in NeuroElf. The conjunction of [Leading &gt; Rest] ∩ [Following &gt; Rest] was also performed on these three groups in order to serve as a reference for the general network of brain areas activated by the movement tasks, irrespective of role. It was performed at a two-tailed statistical threshold of   p   &lt; 0.005 uncorrected with a cluster-level correction of   k   = 49 voxels determined with Alphasim. 

Since qualitative differences were found (see Results section), we tested further for the effect of role by performing whole-brain regression analyses on the full group of participants (  n   = 18). We chose to perform statistical regression analyses instead of a direct statistical comparison between leaders and followers for two reasons. First, we consider role expertise to be a continuous trait, rather than a dichotomous one. Dancers can belong to both groups if they are trained at both leading and following. Thus a binary distinction would have led to a “male versus female” contrast, rather than a “leader versus follower” contrast. Second, the number of participants in each group was small (  n   = 10 and 11 for leaders and followers, respectively), whereas the regression involved the full group of 18 participants. Because of the small number of participants in the analysis and because of the small number of female leaders and male followers in the cohort, we consider this an exploratory study. Future studies will need to examine larger numbers of participants who have both leading and following skills, although such dual training tends to be limited to professional teachers of a dance. 

For the whole-brain regression analyses, the self-reported values of leading and following skill were used as covariates in two separate analyses to regress the betas values of the contrast “Leading versus Following”. These regressions were also performed at a two-tailed statistical threshold of   p   &lt; 0.005 uncorrected with a cluster-level correction of   k   = 25 voxels, determined with Alphasim. However, this threshold led to null results, and so we reported the activation at a less stringent threshold of   p   &lt; 0.025 uncorrected with a cluster-level correction of k = 46 voxels, determined with Alphasim. We note that these results should be interpreted with caution and need to be replicated in future analyses. In order to examine the influence of gender, the mean beta value of each activated cluster was extracted for each participant and regressed against his/her corresponding leading or following skill. 



## Results 
  
In order to identify the basic sensorimotor network involved in performing our joint bimanual tasks, we carried out the conjunction of [Leading &gt; Rest] ∩ [Following &gt; Rest], with results shown in   Figure    and Talairach coordinates reported in   Table   . This shared network between leading and following consisted of a widespread sensorimotor cortical (primary motor and somatosensory cortex) and subcortical (thalamus and cerebellum) network, as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA), midcingulate cortex (MCC), SPL, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), IPL (including the secondary somatosensory cortex [SII] and extending to the insula), and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), extending to the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Except for the ITG, which was present in leaders only, this network was found in both leaders and followers.

With the exception of the inferior temporal gyrus, the activated network is similar in both followers and leaders.

We next wanted to explore our question of interest, namely whether there was evidence for role-specific activations, in other words activations found only in skilled individuals while performing the role they are trained in. This would reveal whether leaders and followers engage different brain resources during leading and following. As shown in   Figure    and   Table   , we first qualitatively compared three types of analyses of the “Leading &gt; Following” contrast (cyan clusters) and “Following &gt; Leading” contrast (yellow clusters): the whole group of 18 participants; only the leaders (a subset of 11 participants); and only the followers (a subset of 10 participants). Overall, the leaders-only analysis showed basically the same network for leading as the whole group, but no brain areas for following. Likewise, the followers-only analysis showed basically the same network for following as the whole group, but only the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for leading (Note that only role-specific activations are labeled in the   Figure   ). 
  
Role-specific brain activations. The figure shows an analysis of the bidirectional “Leading versus Following” contrast in three groupings: the whole group of 18 participants; only the leaders (a subset of 11 participants); and only the followers (a subset of 10 participants). Contrasts are performed at   p   &lt; 0.005 uncorrected (  k   = 28 voxels). The top panel is the midsagittal view, the lower left panel is the left hemisphere, and the lower right panel is the right hemisphere. Each panel is set up as a triad, with the whole group at the top and the restricted analyses of leaders-only and followers-only below that. Cyan clusters and outlines reflect the contrast of “Leading &gt; Following”, whereas yellow clusters and outlines reflect the reverse contrast of “Following &gt; Leading”. In order to facilitate the visualization of role-specific activations, we use colored outlines to represent whole-group activations that are missing in either the leaders-only or the followers-only analyses. More specifically, cyan outlines are regions of whole-group activation that are present in the leaders-only analysis, but not the followers-only analysis, while yellow outlines are regions of whole-group activation that present in the followers-only analysis, but not the leaders-only analysis. The leaders-only analysis shows the same network for leading as the whole group, but no brain areas for following. The followers-only analysis shows the same network for following as the whole group, but only the cerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for leading. Only role-specific activations are labeled in this figure. Leading network: CMA: cingulate motor area; PMC, premotor cortex; SMA, supplementary motor area; and SPL, superior parietal lobule. Following network: PCC, posterior cingulate cortex and TPJ, temporo-parietal junction.

Regarding the leading task, role-specific activations that were found exclusively in skilled leaders (cyan activations in   Figure    in both the leaders-only and whole-group brains that correspond with the cyan outlines in the followers-only brain) were observed in the SMA and cingulate motor area (CMA; top panel), SPL (right and left hemispheres in the lower panels), and PMC(left hemisphere). In addition, while leading, leaders showed a more extended premotor activation than the whole-group, especially in the right hemisphere (  Table   ). 

Regarding the following task, role-specific activations that were found exclusively in skilled followers (yellow activations in   Figure    in both the followers-only and whole-group brains that correspond with the yellow outlines in the leaders-only brain) were observed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; top panel), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ; right and left hemispheres in the lower panels), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC, not shown). In addition, while following, followers showed activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) that was not present in the whole group (  Table   ). To summarize, the networks associated with leading and following seemed to be more strongly engaged by experts at the corresponding role than non-experts at that role. 

We followed up on these qualitative analyses with whole-brain regressions in which the self-reported expertise at being a leader or follower (see   Figure    above) was used as the covariate for the contrast of leading versus following. Activations for these analyses were only found at a more lenient threshold, but are still reported since they are consistent with both our hypotheses and the qualitative analyses reported above. However, the results should be interpreted with caution.   Figure    shows the regressions with leader skill, and   Figure    shows the regressions with follower skill. The regions where activations during the leading task correlated with leader skill included the SMA, pre-SMA, dorsal PMC (dPMC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and insula (  Figure    top panel,   Table   ). The regions where activations during the following task correlated with follower skill include the PCC, TPJ, pSTS, and mPFC (  Figure    top panel,   Table   ). For each cluster, the coefficient of determination (  R  ) of the regression of the mean beta value against leader and follower skill is shown in   Tables  ,   , respectively.

The top panel of this figure shows brain activity that correlates with the contrasts “Leading &gt; Following” (cyan activations) and “Following &gt; Leading” (yellow activations). Contrasts are performed at   p   &lt; 0.02 uncorrected (  k   = 25 voxels). Brain areas for “Leading &gt; Following” that correlate with leader skill include the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), insula (Ins.), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Almost no areas for the contrast “Following &gt; Leading” correlate with leader skill (see   Table   ). The lower plots show mean beta values extracted from the SMA, dPMC, posterior insula and STG against leader skill, where female participants are shown with red dots and male participants with blue dots. Activity for leading increased with increasing leader skill, and this seems to be independent of gender. 
    
Regression of brain activation with the follower skill in the whole group of participants. The top panel of this figure shows brain activity that correlates with the contrasts “Leading &gt; Following” (cyan activations) and “Following &gt; Leading” (yellow activations). Contrasts are performed at   p   &lt; 0.02 uncorrected (  k   = 25 voxels). Brain areas for “Following &gt; Leading” that correlate with follower skill include the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PCC), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). No areas appeared for the contrast “Leading &gt; Following” correlate with follower skill (see   Table   ). The lower plots show mean beta values extracted from the TPJ, PCC, mPFC, and pSTS against follower skill, where female participants are shown with red dots and male participants with blue dots. Activity for following increased with increasing follower skill, and this seems to be independent of gender.

Examples of how the mean beta value in these regions covaries with leader and follower skill are shown in the bottom panels of   Figures  ,   , respectively. The results provide some evidence that activity in these regions might depend on the level of expertise. However, they in no way rule out a gender effect, either alone or in interaction with expertise, and so the results have to be seen as preliminary. In the dPMC and STG (  Figure   , bottom panels), activity for the contrast of “Leading &gt; Following” increased with leader skill, but a male with low leader skill had a low activity, whereas females with high leader skill had a high activity. Other areas that correlated with leader skill had the same trend (not shown). Similarly, in the mPFC and TPJ (  Figure   , bottom panels), activity for the contrast “Leading &gt; Following” decreased with follower skill (that is, “Following &gt; Leading” activity increased with follower skill), but a male with high follower skill had a low activity, similar to females with high follower skill. Other areas that correlated with follower skill had the same trend (not shown). Future studies will be needed to fully exclude the influence of gender on the expertise effects observed here. Hence, the current study must be seen as a pilot study that gives a first glimpse at role-specific expertise effects without being able to effectively factor out the influence of gender. 


## Discussion 
  
This current exploratory study examined for the first time the effect of expertise at the coordinative skills involved in leading and following on brain activations during a joint-action task in a realistic setting. Its results provide support for the existence of role-specific brain activations during joint actions. In particular, we observed that leading-related activations were enhanced in leaders compared to followers when both groups performed the leading task, and that following-related activations were enhanced in followers compared to leaders when both groups performed the following task. Additionally, we showed that leading-related brain regions in the whole group of participants tended to correlate with expertise at being a leader, whereas following-related brain regions tended to correlate with expertise at being a follower. Another way of conceptualizing these results is that the skilled leaders hardly engaged any areas during following that were not already engaged during leading; likewise, the skilled followers hardly engaged any areas during leading that were not already engaged during following. This might explain the null results found in some previous studies when comparing following with leading ( ). These results suggest that expertise at one role of a joint-action task can enhance brain activations for the trained role compared to the untrained role. Hence, not only do the results support the existing literature on expertise effects for motor tasks, but they extend it for the first time to the contrastive roles of leader and follower in joint actions. 

The major finding of the initial qualitative analysis (  Figure   ) was that the brain networks that we observed for leading and following in the whole group seemed to be mainly supported by prior experience at being a leader or follower. In particular, skilled followers strongly engaged the mentalizing and social networks (PCC, TPJ, and STS) while following, which is consistent with a view of following as a process of adapting to one’s partner or as inferring knowledge from one’s partner ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In contrast, skilled leaders strongly engaged networks for motor control and planning (SMA, CMA, PMC, and cerebellum) and for spatial navigation and exploration (SPL) while leading, which is consistent with the requirements of the leading role ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Interestingly, both skilled leaders and skilled followers activated the DLPFC during leading, which implies that self-initiation and action selection ( ;  ;  ) are probably the most important characteristics of leading, regardless of expertise. 

By performing whole-brain regressions with leading or following skill, we treated being a leader or follower as a continuous trait, rather than a dichotomous one. Although we did not find any activity using our   a priori   threshold, the activations observed at a more lenient threshold were consistent with both our hypotheses and the qualitative results, and are thus reported as exploratory findings. We observed that distinct brain areas tended to correlate with the level of self-reported expertise at being a leader or a follower, respectively. The areas that correlated with follower skill were principally components of the following network, such as the mPFC, PCC, TPJ, and pSTS. Thus, the more that someone is trained at following, the more that s/he will recruit brain regions of the mentalizing and social networks, which might indicate more attention to, or more efficient processing of, social stimuli (i.e., cues coming from the leader) and the mental states of others (i.e., their intentions and action plans). Another characteristic of followers is their ability to track their partner’s movements or other signaling cues so as to produce either imitative or complementary movements. Along these lines, the pSTS has been specifically implicated in the multisensory perception of biological motion ( ;  ), indicating that a trained follower might be specialized in analyzing information coming from the partner’s movement, not least haptic information emanating from body contact ( ). 

In contrast to this profile for following, the areas that tended to correlate with leader skill were mainly part of the leading network, including premotor areas (pre-SMA, SMA, and PMC). Other areas that tended to correlate with leader skill were the insula and STG. This network is quite similar to the one shown to be activated by motor experts in the meta-analysis of  . In addition, all of the areas associated with leader skill in the present study have been previously shown to be involved in improvisation ( ). Since leading requires the ability to improvise movements, we can assume that the better a person is at leading, the better s/he can improvise a motor plan for both the self and the partner, and thus the more s/he recruits premotor areas and the STG. However, it has also been shown that improvisational expertise (in musicians, for example) is related to a deactivation in the DLPFC, TPJ, IFG, and insula ( ;  ), which has been interpreted as indicating an automation of cognitive processing and a greater focus on internal processes during improvisation ( ). The absence of deactivations in these regions in our study can potentially be explained by the fact that our use of a joint task may have precluded the adoption of an internal focus by the participants when leading. Indeed, a study of joint improvisation also found an activation increase in the DLPFC, pre-SMA, and STG ( ), which is quite similar to a situation of improvising with a dance partner when leading. 

Overall, the study integrates two issues in the cognitive neuroscience of motor performance, first the contrast between leading and following, and second the influence of individual differences in motor expertise on brain activations. As mentioned in the Introduction, many experimental studies of joint action randomly assign people to being a leader or follower of a joint task ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, in Western dance culture, people are generally assigned these roles based on their gender, with men tending to be assigned the role of leader in couple dances. Thus, in contrast to a study of piano duetting ( ), for example, people come to a dance study like ours with years of experience at just one role of the joint task. This provides us with the unique ability to examine individual differences in joint action based not on random factors but on role-specific training. Previous studies of expertise processing have demonstrated enhanced brain activations in experts compared to non-experts ( ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, this has often has been investigated using non-motor tasks, even in motor experts like professional ballet dancers ( ). We have instead probed this using a motor task, with the added benefit of doing this using a joint-action task. The integration of these two issues is that we were able to examine the contrast between leading and following–as per studies of joint action–but to incorporate the factor of prior motor experience, as per studies of expertise processing. The results revealed a clear overlap between these two issues, such that the brain activations during the acts of leading and following were enhanced by prior expertise at being a leader or follower, and that activity in task-specific brain areas tended to be positively correlated with the level of expertise at the corresponding role. In other words, we were able to demonstrate   role-specific enhancements   in brain activation. 

### Limitations 
  
Given that this study was a first attempt to examine the effect of role expertise on brain activations during joint action, we are aware that it has a number of significant limitations. First, we were limited in our ability to measure behavioral performance during task production in the scanner due to an absence of MRI-compatible technologies such as motion capture at our imaging center. Thus, we cannot determine if the differences between leaders and followers seen in the study are due to trait-related differences in activation or behavioral differences as well. The joint-action task performed in this study was quite simple and involved very small hand movements. Hence, it did not require any type of specialized skill, which would foster similar performance in the two groups. In addition, the experimenter was the sole interaction partner for all of the participants in the study and was thus a controlled factor in the interaction. However, the absence of a technology like motion capture means that we are unable to rule out behavioral differences between participants as a source of the results. Further research taking advantage of MRI-compatible technologies will be required to explore this issue. 

Second, the qualitative analyses showed an interesting pattern that was confirmed by the whole-group regression at a more lenient threshold, but not at a standard threshold. Hence, the effects seem to be small. Although the observed activations at the less stringent threshold were consistent with our expectations based on previous studies, the results of this study should be taken with caution and need to be replicated, preferentially with a larger cohort and a wider spread of skill levels. In addition, the skill levels that were used to regress the brain data were self-report data. They might thus have been subject to self-report biases and inaccuracies. However, no objective measure of leadership and/or followership skills exists in the literature. Given the preliminary results of this study, it would be worthwhile to develop such measures in future. Such measures could be used to see if the results of the present study could be replicated based on people’s role expertise in some other motor skill outside of dancing, or even on people’s natural predispositions to be a leader or follower, as related to personality traits and life experiences, rather than the specialized skill of dance training. 

Finally, and importantly, we are unable to rule out gender as a factor in determining the role-specific effects in our study, and hence the results need to be seen as quite preliminary. While the leader and follower groups were not exclusively of one gender, they did have a majority of one gender. Given the evidence for gender effects on a diversity of perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), further studies will be required to assess a gender contribution to our results with trained couple dancers. Given the paucity of female leaders and male followers in the world of couple dancing, perhaps the only approach that will be able to address the limitations of the current study is a training study. A study that crosses gender with role during a several-month training program of leading or following for some joint-action task could permit a disentangling of the relative effects of gender and expertise. If female leaders and male followers showed the same role-specific effects as in the current study, this would argue against a gender interpretation in favor of expertise   per se  . Such a study could also reveal potential gender effects as well. 



## Conclusion 
  
This study is the first to look at the influence of prior individual training at being a leader or follower on the brain activations occurring during the acts of leading and following, thereby assessing the effect of role expertise during naturalistic joint action. Our major finding was that leaders and followers do not seem approach leading and following in the same way at the neural level, with leaders engaging more brain resources during leading, and followers during following, thus reflecting role-specific activations. Additionally, we showed that activity in leading-related brain regions tended to correlate with expertise at being a leader, and likewise that activity in following-related brain regions tended to correlate with expertise at being a follower. These findings highlight the fact that the acts of leading and following might be skill-specific, and thus that prior experience at these roles should be assessed when studying leading and following during joint action. However, given our inability to disentangle gender from dance role, the current results must be seen as preliminary. A training study that crosses gender with role will probably be required to truly distinguish dance role from gender.
