The aim of the present study was to investigate how different types of social support reduce negative feelings associated with social exclusion and its activation at the neural level. Human beings have a fundamental need to interact with each other. Ostracism (social exclusion) threatens this need and has various effects on cognition, affect and behavior ( ). It is often associated with experiences of pain, often called social pain, defined as ‘the distressing experience arising from the perception of actual or potential psychological distance from close others or a social group’ ( ;  ).   refers to it as one of the most painful and emotionally unpleasant conditions that the individual can live with, as it bears the risk of damaging his ability to relate to other individuals. Experimental neuroscientific research over the past decades has extensively focused on the understanding of ostracism’s neurophysiological underpinnings. Mainly investigated via computer-controlled ball-tossing games (the cyberball game, see   for review), the experience of exclusion from the game (social exclusion) usually results in feelings of unpleasantness and discomfort, with concomitant recruitment of a network of brain areas associated with the processing of negative affect, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) ( ;  ;  ;  ) and the anterior insula (AI) ( ). It is currently a matter of debate if the fingerprint of social exclusion resembles the negative experience associated with pain of physical nature ( ;  ). For example, the experiences of social exclusion and physical pain reflect many common psychological and biological characteristics: from the use of similar words (‘I feel hurt’) ( ), the involvement of overlapping neurochemical ( ;  ) and neural systems ( ), to comparable inflammatory responses and genetic regulation ( ;  ;  ). These commonalities may stem from similar adaptive evolutionary functions ( ). As physical damage to an organism threatens its survival, and the presence of pain lead to protective responses via unpleasant and distressing psychological states, feelings of pain and discomfort after separation from the individual’s social group may serve as protective factors preventing such separation. Consequently, social pain may have promoted safety in a similar manner as physical pain; when a ‘socially painful’ event has occurred, it may drive the individual to repair the social relationship or to seek new ones ( ). However, behaviors that are adaptive when an individual experiences acute pain, e.g. avoiding activities that increase pain, when pain becomes chronic may develop into patterns of behavior that are maladaptive and impair long-term health ( ). Similarly, social pain responses that are situationally appropriate, e.g. feeling angry or avoiding a group after being rejected, may lead to less-effective coping and long-term social isolation, when they become a chronic issue ( ). Given the negative and serious long-term consequences of pain exposure, it is mandatory therefore to understand and promote factors that facilitate the remission or prevent the initiation of such psychological and behavioral effects. In that regard, positive aspects of one’s social world (social support) may improve coping responses and overall well-being. For example, according to  , p. 11), social support is configured as an ‘exchange of resources between two individuals, perceived by the one who provides it - or by those who receive it - as something aimed at increasing the well-being of the recipient’.   describes it in terms of perceived and real, useful and/or significant supplies provided by the community, social networks and trustworthy partners associated to the well-being of the subject.   identifies different types of social support:   `  emotional support’ is associated with sharing life experiences and involves the provision of empathy, love, trust and care; `instrumental support’ involves behaviors that directly help people in need using tangible help (like tangible services and economic benefits); `informational support’ involves the provision of advice, suggestions and information that a person can use to address problems; and finally `appraisal support’ involves the provision of information that is useful for evaluation purposes: constructive feedback, affirmation and social comparison. Several empirical studies ( ;  ;  ) have examined the function of social support on the perception of physical pain, demonstrating a remarkable correlation between social support and the reduction of physical pain experience. Meaningful social connections have also been shown to serve a protective role in reducing neural, physiological and neuroendocrine responses to pain and stress including heart rate, blood pressure and cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses ( ;  ). Given the strong commonalities between physical and social pain, it is not surprising that the interest on the effects of social support on physical pain has been extended to stressors of social nature, with similar results reported. In particular, psychosocial stress caused by social evaluation ( ) has been observed to be reduced by social support ( ). Interestingly, different types of social supports (verbal support, physical contact) have been associated to different reactions in women ( ), suggesting that not all types of social support are effective in reducing the physiological responses to social stress. In spite of the rich scientific literature on social support and psychological stress upon social evaluation, only few studies have directly examined the effects of social support on the feeling of social pain caused by, for example, social exclusion or ostracism. Similarly, to psychological stress, these studies suggest that the presence of a friend ( ), supportive emotional texts ( ) or gentle slow touch ( ) are able to reduce the negative feelings caused by social exclusion. On the neural level, self-reported supportive daily life interactions have been shown to diminish neuroendocrine stress responses and to correlate with decreased activity in the dACC following ostracism ( ). Similarly,   observed that supportive emotional text leads to reduced AI and enhanced theory of mind (ToM) network activity ( ;  ;  ;  ) during social exclusion. 

To date, however, a single study examining how different types of social support modulates feelings of social pain and how this is represented at the neural level has not been performed yet. Our study aimed, for the first time, at disclosing the role of different support strategies in modulating the behavioral and neural correlates involved in social exclusion. Specifically, we used two different types of support: emotional physical support (emotional support), which we implemented as gentle touch, and informational/appraisal support (appraisal support), which we implemented as informative text messages allowing to better understand the situation. In line with the previous literature, we hypothesized feelings of social pain, induced via exclusion from a virtual ball-tossing game, to be reduced after experiencing social support. Furthermore, we hypothesized such behavior to be associated with reduced activity of the neural network involved during the experience of social exclusion. Finally, we expect different neurophysiological effects depending on the type of social support experienced. In particular, we expected the emotional support group to show modulatory effect in the affective network (e.g. AI, ACC) while the appraisal support group to additionally modulate the ToM network ( ) 


## METHODS 
  
### Participants 
  
In total, 81 Italian female volunteers (age, 21.67 ± 2.29 years) with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders (assessed with semi-structured interviews conducted by a psychologist) were recruited among undergraduate students at the University of Turin. We chose to include females only, as gender differences on social exclusion are well-documented (see  ;  ). All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ). Female friends of a similar age as the participants were invited to participate in the experiment, and instructed to act as confederates. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: appraisal support group (N = 26), emotional support group (N = 26) and no support group (N = 29). Ten participants were excluded from the study because of excessive movement or lack of compliance during the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) session, leaving the final sample for the three groups as follows: appraisal support group (N = 23), emotional support group (N = 23) and no support group (N = 25). All participants signed the information
consent after the experimental procedures have been described to them. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Turin. 


### Social pain task 
  
In order to create in the fMRI environment the uncomfortable situation in which participants could experience social exclusion, we used a modified version of the well-known `cyberball game’ ( ), which has been widely used in the literature ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Our version was developed by  , who replaced the animated cartoons of the cyberball game by videos showing schematic virtual representations of real people tossing the ball to each other. The task was composed of 10 blocks with two experimental conditions: `social inclusion’ and `social exclusion’. In each block the ball-tossing game included a total of 12 passes, distributed between three players (including the participant). In the five blocks inducing the experience of social inclusion, the participant received at least one third of the total passes, while in the five blocks inducing social exclusion, the participant received less than one third of the total passages (see   for a detailed description of the stimuli preparation and procedure). Once the participant received the ball, she had to decide to whom to throw it back by pressing with her index (left player) or middle (right player) finger on an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible button box. The presentation of the blocks was equal for all the participants with a pseudorandomized order: the first three and the last two blocks belonged to the inclusion condition, while the five blocks placed in the central position of the task belonged to the exclusion condition. Each ball-tossing game had an average duration of 33.5 s (range, 30–40 s). At the end of each game, the participant was asked to answer the question ‘How are your emotions?’ in order to report the valence and intensity of the emotions experienced during the game on a Likert scale with nine discrete values (from −4 = very negative on 0 to +4 = very positive) displayed for 4 s. The answer was given by using the same button box used to throw the ball (see  ). Of crucial relevance, this sequence of 10 blocks was performed twice, in two separate fMRI runs. In between the runs, emotional or appraisal support was provided by the participant’s friend in the two experimental groups, while no support was provided in the control group. 
  
 Exemplar trial for the social pain task.   In each trial, participants played the game with other two virtual players. During the game, once they receive the ball, they have to decide to whom to throw it back (as illustrated by the two arrows) by pressing the left or right key on the pad. In the inclusion condition, participants received the ball at least one third of the total tosses. In the exclusion condition, participants received the ball less than one third of the total tosses. Immediately after the game, they were asked to answer the question ‘How are your emotions?’ on a 9-point Likert scale, displayed for 4 s. Interstimulus interval was randomly jittered between 1 and 3 s. Arrows in the inclusion condition are inserted only for descriptive purposes and not displayed during the game. 
  

### Social support manipulation 
  
Two experimental groups of social support have been defined: emotional and appraisal. In the emotional support group  ,   each confederate (the female friend) was instructed to gently touch the hand of the participant, with the aim of comforting her. The characteristic of this group was the administration of support only through physical contact, without the use of verbal or expressive linguistic expressions. No specific constraints on how to deliver the touch was given to the confederates. Rather, they should hold, caress and tenderly squeeze her friend’s hand as she would normally do when trying to comfort her. 

In the appraisal support group, social support was given by the participant’s friend through text messages delivered and displayed on the back-projection screen in the scanner. In particular, the participants were told that the phrases they read on the monitor were written and sent directly by their friend from a PC situated in another room, where she could follow the game. Each participant saw 10 pre-prepared phrases meant to give additional information in order to help the understanding of the experience of social exclusion (for example: ‘I think that these two players are actually friends’ or ‘I think that when the experiment will end, we’ll see them go away together’). Importantly, the content of the text was never aimed to comfort the subject but rather to give information allowing the reappraisal of the situation, and it was always emotionally neutral. 

Finally, in order to tease apart the effect of the repetition of the task (adaptation, fatigue, etc.), the control group did the social exclusion task twice but without receiving any kind of support in between. We chose such control condition because the mere presence of a friend, even without delivering any social support, could have affected the following experience of social exclusion ( ). All conditions of social support lasted for 3 min and were delivered between runs 1 and 2 of the cyberball game, while the subject was resting inside the scanner. For the no support group, the same interval was kept between runs 1 and 2, and the subject asked to wait still for the next run to start. 


### Procedure 
  
Each participant, previously randomly assigned to one of three groups, and her friend (except for the no support group in which participants came alone) were received in the fMRI room of the hospital and informed about the study. Specifically, participants were told that they would be connected via Internet to two other players, located in another room of the hospital. After the general information, each confederate was accommodated in the adjacent room for observing through a monitor what happens to her friend during the game. Here she was instructed on what she had to do for the different support conditions. For all participants, after the verbal instruction about the cyberball game, a training session was performed outside of the scanner to ensure that participants understood the game. A second short practice session was administered in the scanner to familiarize the participants with the response recording system. The cyberball game was programmed using Cogent toolbox (2000), running on Matlab 2007 (Mathworks, Cherborn, MA, USA). Inside the scanner, the stimuli were presented via a head coil-mounted display system (Resonance Technology, Inc.). The fMRI session was composed of three phases performed on the same day (see  ): (i) social pain task run 1: each participant was scanned while engaging in the virtual cyberball game, as described above; (ii) social support: each experimental group received social support (e.g. emotional or appraisal), while the control group did not receive any kind of support. During this section, no fMRI scanning was performed. (iii) Social pain task run 2: each participant was scanned for the second time while engaging in the virtual cyberball task, as described above. After the fMRI session, each participant answered a brief interview aimed at investigating the believability of the manipulation. In particular, we asked indirect questions such as: ‘What do you think about the players? How was the game for you? Do you have any comments?’ None of the participants expressed doubts about the veracity of the situation. 
  
 Timeline of the fMRI session.   Each fMRI session was divided into three phases performed on the same day: (i) social pain task run 1, (ii) social support (emotional, appraisal, no support), (iii) social pain task run 2. Social support was either emotional or appraisal for a duration of 3 min. In the case of the no support group, a 3 min break between the two runs was carried out. 
  

### MRI data acquisition 
  
The MRI data were acquired using a 3.0 T MRI Scanner (Philips Ingenia) with a 32-channel array head coil. The study was performed at the Center of Brain Imaging 3 T-NIT, at the Hospital Città della Salute e della Scienza in Turin, Italy. Echo-Planar Image (EPI) sequence [TR/TE, 2000/30 ms; 33 slices, matrix size, 64 × 64; interslice gap, 0.5 mm; field of view (FOV), 230 × 230 mm ; flip angle, 90 degrees; slices aligned to the AC-PC line, 230 volumes/run] for functional images was applied. A total of 226 volumes per subject per run were collected. The first four volumes of each run were discarded to allow the equilibration of T1 saturation effects. T1-weighted sequence MP-RAGE (TR, 8.1 ms; TI, 900 ms; TE, 3.7 ms; voxel size, 1 × 1 × 1 mm ) for structural images of the whole brain was used.

Significant voxels are reported threshold of   P   ≤ 0.05 FWE corrected for small volumes.Peak activity coordinates are given in MNI space. Significant value for   P   &lt; 0.001 uncorrected. 
  

### Data analysis 
  
#### Behavioral analysis 
  
Emotional ratings given by the participants after each round of the cyberball game were analysed in order to investigate differences in the emotional experience between exclusion and inclusion trials and between the first and second run, i.e. before and after receiving social support. We conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA with two within-subjects factors, condition (inclusion, exclusion), time (runs 1 and 2), and one between-subject factor, group (emotional support, appraisal support, no support). Ratings of the exclusion condition were multiplied by −1 in order to carry the same direction as the inclusion ratings, allowing to test the three-way interaction. Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 24. 


#### fMRI data analysis 
  
The MRI data were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) run on Matlab 2007 (Mathworks, Cherborn, MA, USA). All functional images have been pre-processed following this order: spatially realigned to the first volume, co-registered to the mean image, segmented in cerebrospinal fluid tissues, gray matter and white matter, then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and finally smoothed at the first level with an 8 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian Kernel, with an additional 6 mm at the second level. Low-frequency drifts, high-pass temporal filtering with a cut-off of 128 s was used. After preprocessing, a General Linear Model ( ) for statistical analysis was used for both functional runs. Regressors of interest were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. For each participant’s first level analysis, six regressors were computed: social inclusion (I), social exclusion (I), emotion rating (I), social inclusion (II), social exclusion (II) and emotion rating (II). In addition, six parametric regressors of no interest were added to the design matrix to correct residual effects of head motion. At the second level, four contrasts of interest from the first-level analyses were fed into a flexible factorial design aiming at investigating the effect of social support on social exclusion, using a random effects analysis ( ). Linear contrast of the repeated-measures ANOVA with the within-subject factors, condition (exclusion, inclusion), time (runs 1 and 2), and the between-subject factor, group (emotional support, appraisal support, no support), were used to assess the interaction between the factors group and time. Given the main research question of our paper, only results for the exclusion condition are reported. We performed whole brain analyses with an initial threshold of   P   &lt; 0.001 uncorrected and reports clusters that survived Family-Wise Error (FWE) correction for small volumes (SVC) at   P   &lt; 0.05. For the SVC, we created two binary masks encompassing, first, the affective network specifically detected in social exclusion paradigms, and second, a network associated to representing other minds and intentions (ToM). Both masks are based on the most recent published meta-analyses on social exclusion and ToM, respectively. More specifically, the first mask included coordinates derived from two meta-analyses on social exclusion published by   and  . In spite of repeated attempts, it was, however, not possible to receive the original maps from both authors. Therefore, spheres of 10 mm radius centered on the reported main activation loci were generated and combined into one mask with the toolbox MarsBaR ( ). The second mask was provided as an image-based mask by ( ), based on their meta-analysis on ToM tasks (see   for more details). Given we did not expect the involvement of the ToM network for the emotional support group, only the first (affective) mask was used to investigate differences in activations between this group and the no support group. To investigate differences in activations between the appraisal support and no support groups and the emotional support and appraisal support groups, both the affective and the ToM masks were used. The MRIcron software package ( ;  ) was used for anatomical and cytoarchitectonic display and interpretation. 


#### Brain–behavior correlation analyses 
  
Pearson correlation analyses between brain activity and behavioral ratings were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 24. In particular, the difference in activity (∆) between the first and second run of social exclusion in the regions showing significant statistical difference (see  ) was correlated with the difference in emotional ratings between the two runs (run 1 minus run 2). Activity in these regions was extracted with REX (  http://web.mit.edu/swg/rex/rex.pdf  ). Correlations were performed for each group separately and corrected for the number of ROIs used in each group. 




## RESULTS 
  
### Behavioral results 
  
The ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect time*condition*group [  F   = 3.39,   P   = 0.040, partial Eta squared = 0.091]. All the other effects and interactions were not significant (  F   &lt; .103) . Post hoc pairwise comparisons were used in order to characterize the effect of the triple interaction. In particular, in the emotional support group, a significant difference between exclusion run 1   vs   run 2 was observed, defined by a reduction of unpleasantness ratings during the second run (  M   = 5.57, SE = 1.91,   P   = 0.005). In the appraisal support group  ,   a significant difference between exclusion run 1   vs   run 2 was also observed, but with an opposite pattern, namely an increase of unpleasant emotions in the second run (  M   = −3.93, SE = 1.91,   P   = 0.044). The no support group did not show any significant difference between runs 1 and 2 for both conditions (see  ). Finally, the differences between the inclusion and exclusion runs (Δ inclusion, Δ exclusion) were entered in a one-way ANOVA to assess whether the groups significantly differed. The analysis revealed a significant difference between the groups in the Δ exclusion only (  F   = 6.22,   P   = 0.003). Post hoc multiple comparisons were used in order to characterize the effect. In particular, we observed a significant difference both between the emotional support group and the no support group (  M   = 0.564, SE = 0.265,   P   = 0.037) and the emotional support group and the appraisal support group (  M   = 0.949, SE = 0.270,   P   = 0.001).

### Brain-behavior correlation analyses 
  
The following correlations were performed: (i) for the emotional support group, correlation between ∆ activity in rAI and ∆ unpleasantness ratings and (ii) for the appraisal support group, correlation between ∆ activity in rTPJ, subACC and ∆ unpleasantness ratings. The correlation analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between ∆ subACC and ∆ unpleasantness ratings in the appraisal support group (r(23) = 0.443,   P   &lt; 0.017 one tailed, corrected for the number of correlations performed). This means that in the appraisal support group, the increase of subACC activity observed in the second run of exclusion was associated to increased unpleasantness feelings in the second run ( ). All the other correlations were not significant. 



## DISCUSSION 
  
In the present study, we investigated the effects of different types of social support (emotional and appraisal) on the behavioral and neural correlates of the experience of social exclusion. Seventy-one female participants were scanned twice while playing the cyberball game. Between the two runs of the game, different types of support were delivered by a female friend. At the behavioral level, we observed that, compared to the control group (no support), the sample that received emotional support in the form of gentle touch, reported reduced feeling of unpleasantness during exclusion trials between the first and second run of the game, i.e. after they had received the emotional support. Our results are in line with the findings of  , which showed reduced reported distress associated to ostracism, after being touched with optimal speed (3 cm/s) to induce positive feelings and thereby promoting interpersonal touch and affiliative behavior ( ). By adding these results, our study was able to show for the first time that the experience of emotional support is associated, at the neural level, to a reduction of activity in right AI, a brain area involved in the processing of negative affect during social exclusion and self- and other-directed aversive experiences ( ;  ;  ). The effects of emotional social support on the experience of social pain resemble the findings reported on pain of physical nature ( ;  ). In particular, during the administration of painful stimuli, married women who held the hand of their partners indicated a lower value of perceived pain. The subjective experience was correlated with reduced activation of the brain areas involved in pain processing, including the AI ( ). Moreover, imagined social support, provided through the visualization of images portraying of loved ones, was also able to modify the neural activation of the insula ( ;  ) and reduce the feeling of distress upon physical pain. The similar effect of emotional support on social and physical pain suggests overlapping regulatory mechanisms, possibly associated to the activity of the μ-opioid system and its analgesic properties ( ). 

The more informative type of support yielded instead different results. At the behavioral level, participants reported increased feelings of unpleasantness after receiving information about the other two participants. The subjective experience was accompanied by a reduced activation in the right TPJ, an area included in the ToM network ( ;  ;  ) and involved in incongruency detection and self-other distinction ( ;  ;  ). TPJ is considered a central structure implicated in the representation of mental states of others ( ). A recent study has associated the function of this brain region to the update of the internal models of the situation in order to generate appropriate actions to the social contexts ( ). This function is particularly important when faced with unexpected stimuli that demand attention reorienting and model updates. The findings of the present study suggest that the information received during the support possibly allowed the participants to interpret what was happening during the first run of the game. Indeed, the participants that received information (e.g. ‘the two players are friends’ or ‘there is understanding between them’) leading to a better understating of the social situation, showed an increase of unpleasant emotions (possibly anger) and possibly a reduced need to understand what was happening, indicated by reduced activity in TPJ. To corroborate this hypothesis, we observed increased recruitment of the subACC after receiving the appraisal support. Furthermore, the increased activity in subACC was positively correlated with the increased negative feelings reported during the second run. Interestingly, the subACC is a region involved in affective processes but not in physical pain ( ). Several social pain studies have indicated an increase in activity in the subACC during the negative experience of social exclusion ( ;  ;  ).   indicated the possibility that greater responsivity in the subACC during peer rejection could reflect an inability to properly regulate emotions evocated by negative events. In line with this literature, some studies have shown that this area is more responsive to negative emotional stimuli among depressed patients and correlates to the severity of depressive symptoms ( ;  ). Notably and differently from subACC, the increased negative affect did not result in a concomitant increase of AI activity, suggesting that the effects of ostracism on affective pain-related brain areas were not modulated by this type of support received. These findings point to a different role of these two areas in emotional processing during social exclusion, possible link to affective saliency and the need of emotion regulation. Our results are partially in line with the findings by  , who reported different reactions depending on the type of social support (verbal or physical contact) received. In particular, they observed that only physical contact was effective in reducing the symptoms of distress associated to negative social evaluation, while verbal support did not show any different from the no support condition. In our case, though, the appraisal support group showed increased negative feelings and concomitant neural response. It is possible to speculate that the negative reaction observed after appraisal support could have adaptive functions for the person experiencing it, in that it may drive the individual to seek for new relationship, when the actual ones are dysfunctional ( ). 

In conclusion, our study provides the first neuroimaging evidences that experiences of social support can modulate regions of the brain recruited during social pain and possibly responsible for coding the negative valence and intensity of emotion experience. Furthermore, for the first time, we showed that this effect may be different depending on the type of support received. Social support is a very complex phenomenon in which various factors can influence how it is effective for the receiver (e.g. who is providing it, in which form, etc.). It has been shown that it does not always result in a reduction of the negative experiences associated to social stress ( ) and social pain. Instead, as observed in our study, it can also increase the negative emotional experience, which can still be functional for the individual in the short term. Therefore, it is very important to understand under which conditions (contextual, personal, modality, etc.) social support can represent an effective and positive resource to alleviate the negative consequences of social exclusion. Importantly, our findings are restricted to a female sample; therefore not generalizable to the entire population. Future studied are needed to extend these findings to samples representative of the general population such as male participants and different age groups ( ) and to explore alternative types of social support (e.g. instrumental, informational).

Although 90% of the subjects self-reported that genetic relationship was not relevant, their brain activity told a different story. Comparing correlations of brain activity across all subject pairs between the two viewing conditions, we found significantly stronger inter-subject correlations in insula, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal, superior temporal, and superior parietal cortices, when the subjects believed that the sisters were genetically related. Cognitive functions previously associated with these areas include moral and emotional conflict regulation, decision making, and mentalizing, suggesting more similar engagement of such functions when observing refusal of altruism from a genetic sister.

Evaluating and predicting social interactions of others is an integral part of social cognition, one of the most fundamental of human cognitive functions. Indeed, the evolution of social cognition may best explain why humans have a more developed neocortex than other species . So far, social cognition has been predominantly studied with stimuli depicting interactions between strangers, however, most of the significant interactions evaluated in daily life are between one’s family members, friends, and acquaintances 

More importantly, most of our social interactions (and social effort) is directed to a very small number of familiar individuals, 60% of our social effort is directed to just 15 close friends and family . There is also considerable experimental and observational evidence for a “kinship premium” in our interactions with others, especially when those interactions involve altruistic behaviour . We are more likely to help our genetic relatives compared to unrelated individuals, and to do so implicitly, without conscious elaboration . In a trolley dilemma , subjects have to decide if they would push a handle to set a trolley to another track so that instead of killing five people when left without intervention, it will kill a single person on an alternative track. If only strangers are considered, the study subjects favoured the survival of the five over one life; however, their judgement changed if the single person was genetically related to the subject. 

On the other hand it has been shown, that subjects judged incest to be equally morally wrong for a sibling, irrespective of whether this was a genetic, adoptive or step sibling . In these studies, rather co-residence with the sibling in the family, irrespective of genetic status, was the most relevant factor in decisions about the moral reprehensibility of incest. 

These and many other studies, have shown differences in multiple aspects of moral perception/processing, evaluation, judgement and decision making at the behavioural level when processing information about kin vs. non-kin. However, much less is known about the neuronal underpinnings of these effects. Recently, Wlodarski and Dunbar  have shown that different brain regions are active when subjects judge moral dilemmas about kin vs. friends. They found the sensorimotor cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex to be more strongly activated when the subjects processed social information about their friends than about their kin. These differences imply that the brain processes kinship information differently than information on unrelated individuals. 

We explored this further by comparing subjects’ brain responses to a moral dilemma involving a pair of genetic versus adoptive (  i  .  e  ., unrelated) sisters. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the subjects viewed the same movie involving two sisters, but one group was primed with the information that they were genetic sisters and the other group with the information that they were sisters by adoption. The case of sisters related genetically vs. by adoption is especially suitable for testing whether knowledge of genetic relationship influences perception of a moral dilemma between kin given that there is no potential for shared genetic interest in future generations for adopted siblings . Note, however, that the current study examined perception of a kin relationship that subjects were seeing in a movie, while in Wlodarski and Dunbars  analysis the subjects answered questions about their own kin members and friends. 

In the present study, we utilized inter-subject correlation (ISC) of brain hemodynamic activity as a model-free analysis approach that makes it possible to use movies as ecologically valid stimuli during fMRI. Due to improvements in fMRI acquisition methods and data analysis algorithms , it has become possible to study specific aspects of social cognition between subjects using ecologically valid fMRI paradigms. The ecological validity is particularly important when studying moral dilemmas in order to engage the subjects and make the dilemma as credible and perceptible as possible in order to get authentic reactions. To investigate the degree of similarity in how individual brains respond to the common movie stimulus, the brains of individual subjects are aligned and ISC between the hemodynamic activity time courses for each voxel are calculated across all subject pairs. ISC can be interpreted as reflecting synchronized neural activity and thus similarity of cerebral information processing across individuals . It has been shown that when viewing a feature film during brain scanning, both “higher-order” prefrontal cortical as well as basic sensory cortex regions become synchronized across subjects . Further, ISC may not only reflect mutual neuronal responses, but could provide the basis of inducing a specific common mind set, e.g. built by context information or perspective taking as well as predicting the actions of others . 

The model-free approach of ISC does not require any a priori, pre-designed modeling of the fMRI signal to carry out the analysis and thus provides a powerful tool to investigate neuronal mechanisms as the correlations are exclusively based on similarities between the subjects’ brain activities when they react to the various aspects of the complex movie . At the same time, ISC has been shown to reliably detect involved brain regions in complex experimental setups almost as sensitively as a model-based analysis . 

In study 1, we asked whether people discriminate behaviourally between relatives with genetic vs. non-genetic backgrounds: In an implicit association test (IAT ) the subjects’ reaction time when associating the words “sister” and “adopted sister” to positive or negative connoted adjectives was measured. Further, after watching the movie, the subjects were asked whether genetic vs. non-genetic relationship status mattered to them in the moral dilemma that they observed. 

In study 2, we tested how the subjects perceived moral dilemmas involving genetically related vs. unrelated individuals during fMRI. In a first task, the subjects watched the movie depicting the moral dilemma between two sisters after being primed that they were either genetically related sisters or sisters related only by adoption. Should knowledge of genetic relationship matter, we expect to see differences in the behavioural tests (IAT; questionnaires) as well as the neuronal mechanisms: we predict that brain regions known to be involved in processing of mentalizing , conflict resolution , emotion regulation , and moral dilemmas  would be activated differently under the two viewing conditions. 

Second, following the hypothesis that moral processing is the most relevant factor to distinguish between watching the movie when believing the sisters to be genetic or adopted (i.e., non-genetic), each subject underwent a moral decision task during fMRI scanning to evaluate specifically which brain areas are associated with the perception and processing of moral dilemmas during movie-watching. In this task the subjects had to decide whom to save from a dangerous area and had different choices including their own sister, best friend, and strangers, an experimental design similar to the classical moral trolley dilemma. Again, if the genetic relationship had an effect on the viewers, as has previously been shown behaviourally , we hypothesize that the subjects will show kinship preference by saving their sister over others and that similar brain areas are engaged both in the decision task and when watching the movie believing that the sisters are genetic. 


## Results 
  
### Study 1: Implicit association test (IAT) 
  
To examine if a possible general implicit bias against adopted sisters (that potentially modulates brain functions during movie viewing) underlies the subjects’ perception of the movie, we asked 30 subjects in a behavioural experiment to undergo an IAT . In this test, reaction times during assignment of positive and negative connoted words to the categories of sister and adopted sister showed that there is no such implicit bias: Out of 30 subjects, nine favoured a genetic sister, 13 a non-genetic sister, and eight had no preference (one sampled t-test t = −0.9564 p = 0.3468). The TOST procedure  indicated that the ratings of emotional closeness were significantly similar (observed effect size (d = −0.17) was significantly within the equivalent bounds of d = −0.68 and d = 0.68; t(29) = 2.77, p = 0.005). 


### Study 2: Inter-subject correlation (ISC) of fMRI during movie watching 
  
#### Inter-subject correlation (ISC) across all conditions 
  
During fMRI scanning the subjects watched a movie depicting a moral dilemma between two sisters, either believing the sisters are genetic sisters or that the younger sister was adopted at birth. In a first step, the overall ISC (22) of hemodynamic activity of an independent set of 30 subjects was calculated during first viewing of the movie (Fig.  ). Significant ISC was observed extensively in occipital lobes, posterior parietal areas, and temporal cortices. In the frontal cortex, areas in the lateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), lateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) showed ISC between all subjects. The location of all brain areas were defined using anatomical brain atlases as specifically the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas and the Juelich Histological Atlas.

#### Differences in ISC between conditions 
  
In a second step, the ISC of all subjects (N = 30) were contrasted between the genetic vs. non-genetic relationship viewing conditions. As each participant watched the movie in the genetic and in the non-genetic condition on two different scanning days in a counterbalanced order, this is a within-subject design. There were robust differences between the two conditions in the ISC of hemodynamic activity of the subjects, despite 90% of the subjects self-reporting that it did not matter to them whether the sisters were related genetically or not. When the subjects watched the movie believing that they were seeing genetically related sisters, the ISC was significantly stronger in the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG), VMPFC, DLPFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), IFG, insula, cuneus, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule (SPL) (Fig.  , Table  ).

(  A  ) Significant differences in brain activity when all subjects watched the movie thinking that the sisters were genetically vs. non-genetically related (FDR q &lt; 0.05, t = 2.1447, for consistent illustration purposes, the figures shows t-values from 3 to 9 and −3 to −9) (N = 30, within subject design). Red-yellow colours indicate areas of significantly higher ISC when the subjects watched the movie as depicting genetically related, as compared to non-genetically related, sisters. Blue colour indicates areas showing significantly higher ISC in the reverse contrast. Abbreviations: ACC = anterior cingulate cortex, CAL = calcarine gyrus, DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, IFG = inferior frontal gyrus, IOG = inferior occipital gyrus, MOG = middle occipital gyrus, PCC = posterior cingulate cortex, SPL = superior parietal lobe, STS/STG = superior temporal sulcus and gyrus, VMPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a = anterior, d = dorsal, p = posterior, v = ventral. (  B  ) Across subjects averaged BOLD time series of two voxels, one in the area VMPFC that showed significantly higher ISC when the subjects were viewing the sisters as genetic and one time series of a voxel in area V1 (primary visual cortex) that did not show significant between-condition ISC differences.

Red and blue shades indicate the 25  and 75  percentile of the variance.

When the subjects thought that the sisters were non-genetic, higher ISC was observed mainly in the occipital cortex. Importantly, the movie stimulus was identical in both viewing conditions. 

To illustrate blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) time series of specific voxels, in Fig.  , the panel B shows the time series of two exemplary voxels, over the whole length of the movie, from: i) VMPFC that showed higher ISC when the subjects viewed the sisters as genetic and ii) from a voxel in the area V1 (primary visual cortex), which is an early sensory brain area that did not show any between condition differences in ISC. 

Self-ratings of emotional valence and arousal obtained after the scans were not significantly different between the conditions (Valence: r = 0.0075, p = 0.3458, Arousal: r = −0.0189, p = 0.6081) (Fig.  ). Further, the mean ISC of eye-movements (eISC) over time windows showed no significant difference between the groups of participants believing in genetic or non-genetic sisters (p = 0.3918) (see Fig.  ). Likewise, no significant difference could be found in the heart and breathing rate comparing the conditions of assumed genetic versus non-genetic sisters (with bootstrap over 5000 permutations, breathing rate: t-value = 0.430, p = 0.335: heart rate: t-value = −1.12, p = 0.129) (see Fig.  ).

(  A  ) Shown are dynamic self-ratings of emotional valence and arousal over the whole time course of the movie obtained during re-viewing of the movie after the fMRI sessions when the sisters were viewed as genetically related (red) or non-genetic (blue). The ratings were highly similar and there were no time periods where significant between-condition differences could have been observed. Note that half of the subjects (N = 2 × 15) rated experienced arousal and the rest rated experienced valence after the first fMRI session followed by rating the other emotional dimension after the second fMRI session. Plotted are means for all subjects in the red line for assumed genetic sisters and the blue line for non-genetic sisters condition.

### Comparison with the moral dilemma decision experiment 
  
To further examine which neurocognitive processes might be involved, we studied whether the brain areas showing higher ISC in the genetic condition overlap with those engaged during a modified moral dilemma task  analysed with general linear modelling (GLM) (Fig.  , Tables   and  ). Naturally, it should be kept in mind that while ISC and GLM analyses of brain hemodynamic activity can yield converging results , this is not necessarily the case, as high ISC can be observed also when the BOLD signals are small.   
Having to decide in a simulation between saving one’s sister, friend, and others from crisis regions elicited significant brain activity in the VMPFC, ACC, precuneus, DLPFC, IFG, insula, TPJ and MTG. These activations of subjects (N = 30) were obtained by contrasting the decision phases (from the point of revealing the individuals involved until the decision signaled by the subject’s button press) against non-decision phases (subjects watching the background story depicting the two crisis regions and how the subjects only have resources to save individuals from one of the crisis regions) (FDR q &lt; 0.05, t = 2.0384, for consistent illustration purposes, the figures shows t-values from 3 to 9) Left-lateralized motor and supplementary motor are probably explained by the button press that the subjects performed to announce their decision.

When the same subjects who watched the movie had to decide between saving their sister, best friend, vs. stranger(s), in various combinations, from a crisis region, 93% of the subjects showed a clear kin preference by choosing their sister (even when associated with some strangers) rather than their best female friend (chi-squared test ×  = 43.4 p &lt; 4 × 10 ). Further, as can be seen in Fig.   the VMPFC, ACC, IFG, MTG, SPL, PCC, precuneus, DLPFC, and anterior insula were consistently involved in both making choices of whom to prefer in a morally dilemmatic situation and when observing the moral dilemma between a genetic vs. non-genetic sister. Importantly, ratings of emotional closeness were not significantly different for the subjects’ sisters and their best friends with an average of 9.28 (sisters) and 8.80 (friends) on a 1–10 scale (Wilcoxon signed rank test = 0.12, t-test, t = 1.64 p = 0.11). The TOST procedure  indicated that the ratings of emotional closeness were significantly similar (observed effect size (d = 0.33) was significantly within the equivalent bounds of d = −0.68 and d = 0.68, or in raw scores: −1.07 and 1.07, t(29) = −1.92, p = 0.032).   
Activity during moral dilemma decision making as disclosed by GLM analysis (red) and the ISC when the subjects believed in a genetic relationship between the sisters in the movie (blue), along with the overlap of these two maps (violet), as well as the more strict overlap with a conjunction test (yellow);  , (FDR q &lt; 0.05, t = 2.0384 for GLM and t = 2.1447 for ISC). Abbreviations: ACC = anterior cingulate cortex, DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, IFG = inferior frontal gyrus, MFC = medial frontal cortex, MOG = middle occipital gyrus, MTG = midddle temporal gyrus, PCC = posterior cingulate cortex. SPL = superior parietal lobe, VMPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a = anterior, d = dorsal, p = posterior, v = ventral. 
  

As measured with an independent group of subjects outside the scanner, reaction times for the moral-dilemma decision were significantly longer in the case of a decision between a group comprised of their friend and four strangers on one side and their sister alone on the other side as in the case that only comprised strangers (on both sides) (paired Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.0011973). 



## Discussion 
  
In the present study, we investigated whether refusing altruism from a sister is perceived differently when the viewers think that the sisters are genetically related vs. when they think that one of the sisters has been adopted at young age. The results of the IAT in study 1 suggest that the subjects do not show an implicit bias against adoptive sisters compared to genetic sisters in general. Also, when explicitly asked if the relationship (as genetic or adopted) would matter in the decision of an organ donation, most subjects (90%) report that this knowledge would not affect the decision. Further, heart rate and breathing rate exhibited no significant differences between the two conditions, and self-reported emotional valence and arousal was likewise similar between the conditions (Fig.  ), suggesting that there were no robust differences in experienced emotions between the conditions. 

In contrast, the ISC of the hemodynamic brain activity show a different picture: robust differences were observed in patterns of brain activity due to the mere knowledge of the genetic relationship between the sisters in the movie. Specifically, there were multiple brain regions showing significantly higher ISC when the subjects thought that they are seeing a young girl refusing to donate her organ to save her genetic, as opposed to non-genetic, sister (Fig.  ). These areas included VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, PCC, insula, precuneus, and SPL. While we would caution against drawing conclusions of specific cognitive functions involved on the basis of observed differences in brain activity, these brain regions have been previously shown to be associated with moral and emotional conflict regulation , decision making , mentalizing , and perspective taking , thus tentatively suggesting more uniform engagement of such neurocognitive functions when observing the dilemma of organ donation between genetic sisters. 

In the reverse contrast (i.e. when the subjects thought the sisters were non-genetic), higher ISC was observed in brain areas in the occipital cortex, conventionally associated mainly with visual perception . One possible explanation could potentially be that in the case of a non-genetic relationship between the sisters, the processing of complex social conflict associated with the moral dilemma is less demanding, and therefore leaves room for the subjects to focus on the visual aspects of the movie. However, eye-movements were not significantly different between the two viewing conditions, suggesting that differences in attention to movie events did not explain the observed robust differences in ISC. 

To specifically test for the possibility that the differences in ISC between the conditions reflected differences in moral evaluation, we compared the areas showing differences in ISC with areas activated when the subjects engaged in a separate moral-decision making control task. In this control task, the subjects had to make choices about saving people (including their sister, best friend, and strangers, in various combinations) from disaster. As each subject made only one decision that contrasted saving the friend over strangers and one decision of saving the friend over the own sister plus four strangers (as well as four decisions that contrasts the sister to groups of others), the statistical power in this experimental design was unfortunately not sufficient to differentiate directly between brain responses during decisions to save the sister vs. the friend. Rather, the results should be viewed as localization of brain regions involved in making moral decisions, yet also modulated by differences in, e.g., executive control, readiness for action, and attention, between the passive perception of the story and active decision making. However, significantly longer reaction times suggested increased difficulty when having to choose between a sister and the friend together with four strangers while areas in the VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, PCC, precuneus, IFG, MTG, SPL and anterior insula were consistently involved in both making choices of whom to prefer in a morally dilemmatic situation and when observing the moral dilemma between a genetic vs. non-genetic sister (Fig.  ). This overlap in engaged brain regions suggests that processing of moral dilemmas took place during movie watching when the sisters were understood to be genetically related. It is significant that the brain regions flagged up in this analysis are those known to be involved in processing moral dilemmas and mentalizing. The DLPFC has been reported to play a role in overcoming a primary moral judgment in favour of greater welfare  and in cortical emotional processing , while the MTG has been implicated in attributing mental states as well as ingroup/outgroup distinctions , the ACC has been reported to be engaged in resolving conflicts , and the SPL, precuneus, and PCC have been implicated in mentalizing and perspective taking . Further, the VMPFC has been associated with viewing moral conflicts, making moral decisions, attributing mental states to self and others, adopting another person’s perspective, and evaluating their beliefs . 

Thus, the differences in ISC between the conditions appear to have arisen due to the knowledge about the sisters’ relationship influencing cognitive evaluation of the moral dilemma depicted in the movie. The contrast to the behavioural results assessed in study 1, where we find that behavioural decisions were not influenced by knowledge of the relationship, is particularly interesting since it suggests that differential processing is taking place under the surface. 

There could be at least two possible explanations for these findings. First, the study subjects might have purposely been hiding their “real” honest opinions as they might have not been willing to reveal these to the researchers, presumably because of social pressure against discriminating between genetic and adoptive siblings. However, the IAT is an implicit test for biases (it uses differences in reaction times for associations of a specific term with positively and negatively connoted words), so subjects are not aware of their performance on this task. Further, they do not know the exact measures which are used to calculate the IAT score, thus making it difficult to engineer potential biases; hence, it is very difficult, even impossible, to manipulate an IAT response in a desired direction . Thus, while a conscious manipulation of reported opinions would be possible in the open-format questionnaire (when asked if the relationship of the sisters matters in the situation of organ donation), it is very unlikely in the IAT. However, Liberman   et al  .  showed that, when judging incest reprehensibility, the coresidence of siblings is a stronger factor than the assumed relationship status and in when the two parameters are in conflict, the time spent in coresidence outweighs the belief of kin relation. As in this study the subjects were told that the apparent adoption took place as the younger sister was a newborn (implying coresidence of the sisters in both the genetic and the adoption case), we suggest, in accordance with Liberman   et al  ., that the factor of coresidence was given greater account than the kin relationship and thus the subjects’ explicit answers in the questionnaire could probably be seen/taken as truthful i.e. reporting authentic, honest thoughts. 

A second possible explanation for our findings is that, as the results of the implicit testing show, the study subjects indeed did not show any biases behaviourally and still pursued different ways of considering the case of a relationship by genes or by adoption, with resulting differences in brain activity patterns. These results show that an event that is behaviourally counter-intuitive (e.g. refusing to help a sister to prolong her life) needs different and potentially more intensive mental processing when the sisters are related genetically compared to adoptive sisters. As the differences in the brain activity patterns between the genetic and the adopted condition particularly comprise areas known to be involved in processing moral dilemmas and mentalizing as the VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, PCC, precuneus, IFG, MTG, SPL, and anterior insula, we suggest that the study subjects’ expectations of morality are more strongly violated when close genetic relatives refuse to help each other than when unrelated individuals behave this way, despite their close social relation (adoption). 

Notwithstanding these points, we wish to caution the reader to keep in mind the caveats associated with reverse inference  (although see ). Specifically, even as we are suggesting that an activation observed in a certain region is indicative of a specific cognitive process based on results of previous research documented in the literature, it is possible that the activation of that region in the present study was due to some other cognitive process. This is because in general any given brain region is involved in multiple cognitive functions, thus making it difficult to infer with certainty the cognitive functions involved in a task based on brain regions that are activated. 

An alternative possibility is that the different measures operate at different levels of cognition: The null result in the IAT could be relying on a more basic level of attention to the social knowledge, whereas the questionnaire requires high level explicit cognition and the ISC during movie perception reflects some intermediate level of cognition. Had we thought to include them, other behavioural tests might have revealed more detail and background information on the subjects. Finally, it is always possible that something other than moral considerations could underlie the differences in brain patterns that we found, although, given the brain areas that show differences, this is unlikely. 

In summary, we observed robust differences in brain activity when subjects viewed a movie depicting refusal to donate an organ to a genetic vs. non-genetic sister. These differences in brain activity were observed despite the subjects self-reporting that the relational status of the sisters did not make any difference to them. Areas of increased synchrony in the case of genetic sisters overlapped with those activated in a separate moral dilemma decision task. Taken together, our results suggest that the precuneus, MTG, insula, SPL, and the VMPFC, along with the associated cognitive processes (i.e., moral and emotional conflict regulation), decision making, mentalizing and perspective taking are synchronized across subjects more robustly when they are viewing refusal of altruism from genetic as opposed to non-genetic, kin. Overall, these findings are fundamentally important for understanding social cognition, a pivotal ability that makes us human and, among other things, enables the existence of societies. Our findings point out that the perceived relationship of interacting persons robustly modulates how the brains of spectators process third-party interactions. This is highly significant given that majority of research to date on social cognition has been on strangers, whereas most of our social interactions take place between family members, friends, and acquaintances. 


## Material and Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
We studied 33 healthy female subjects  (19–39 years, mean age of 26 years, one left-handed, laterality index of right handed 84.5%). None of the subjects reported any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. When asked, all subjects reported either normal vision or corrected to normal vision by contact lenses. Three subjects were excluded due to discomfort in the scanner, so that the final analysis included 30 subjects. 27 of them were native Finnish speakers and three were native Russian speakers. All subjects were sufficiently proficient in English to follow the dialogue in the movie without subtitles. The experimental protocols were approved by the research ethics committee of the Aalto University and the study was carried out with their permission (Lausunto 9 2013 Sosiaalisen kognition aivomekanismit, 8.10.2013) and in accordance with the guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki . Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation. 


### Stimuli and Procedure 
  
The study consisted of two experiments. In the first experiment, the feature film   My Sister’s Keeper”   (dir. Nick Cassavetes, 2009, Curmudgeon Films), edited to 23 minutes and 44 s, (of which 14 min 17 s (60%) portray the theme of refusal of the organ donation),with the main story line retained, was shown to the subjects during fMRI. This shortened version of the movie focuses on the moral dilemma of the protagonist Anna to donate one of her kidneys to her sister Kate, who is fatally ill from cancer. In the course of the movie, Anna refuses to donate and Kate dies. The reason for Anna refusing to donate the kidney was not revealed to the subjects until after the experiment. The movie was shown to the subjects in the scanner four times in two separate scanning sessions on two different days. For each viewing of the movie the instructions were varied regarding the information about the sister’s relationship and the perspective to take in this viewing (Fig.  ). Each subject thus watched the movie assuming that the sisters were genetic sisters or that the younger sister Anna had been adopted as a newborn. In addition each subject was asked to take either the perspective of the potential donor (Anna) or the perspective of the potential recipient (Kate) on separate viewings (and both under the condition of a genetic or non-genetic relation background). The order of the different viewing conditions was counterbalanced between the subjects.   
Experimental procedure and ISC analysis in the movie watching task. (  A  ) Every subject watched the movie four times, in a 2 × 2 design assuming that the movie characters are either genetic sisters or not genetically related and taking the perspective of the to-be-donor sister Anna or the to-be-recipient sister Kate. The order of all the conditions were counter-balanced. (  B  ) Time series from each voxel from all the fMRI recordings are compared across subjects in pairwise correlations to obtain the mean inter-subject-correlation (ISC). 
  

In the second experiment, each subject carried out a moral-dilemma decision task during fMRI in order to localize brain regions that are related to moral decision making. For this purpose, a modified version of the classical trolley dilemma , was shown to the subjects. Each subject had to choose between rescuing different individuals, including unknown individuals, their sister and a best female friend. A presentation showing text and pictures told a story about civil unrest in a fictive distant country. This country had two parts: one part very dangerous and the other much less dangerous. Different people are in both parts of the country. Subjects were also told that as they were very rich and owned an airplane, they could go there and rescue some of the people. However, due to the circumstances in the country they had to decide which group of people to rescue. The two choices were always a group of five individuals on one side and a single person on the other. In seven runs the identity of the involved individual(s) was varied using the real names of the subject’s sister and best female friend. The 7 runs were: 1. All persons are unknown; 2. Sister is with four others in the dangerous part of the country, the single person is unknown; 3. Five persons are in the dangerous part of the country, the single person is the sister; 4. Five persons are in the dangerous part of the country, the single person is the friend; 5. Sister is with four others in the dangerous part of the country, the single person is the friend; 6. Friend is with four others in the dangerous part of the country, the single person is the sister; 7. Sister is with four others in the less dangerous part of the country, the single person is unknown. Responses in the moral dilemma decision task were recorded with a button press on a LUMItouch keypad (Photon Control Inc.8363, Canada). For the all questions, it was calculated with which percentage the sister was chosen over the friend and the stranger(s); statistical significance was tested with a Chi  test. 


### fMRI acquisition 
  
Before each scan the subjects were informed about the scanning procedures and asked to avoid bodily movements during the scans. All stimuli were presented to the subject with the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA), synchronizing the onset of the stimuli with the beginning of the functional scans. The movie was back-projected on a semitransparent screen using a data projector (PT-DZ8700/DZ110X Series, Panasonic, Osaka, Japan). The subjects viewed the screen at 33–35 cm viewing distance   via   a mirror located above their eyes. The audio track of the movie was played to the subjects with a Sensimetrics S14 audio system (Sensimetrics Corporation Malden, USA). The intensity of the auditory stimulation was individually adjusted to be loud enough to be heard over the scanner noise. The brain-imaging data were acquired with a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), at the Advanced Magnetic Imaging center, Aalto University, using a standard 20-channel receiving head-neck coil. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR 2530 ms, TE 3.3 ms, TI 1100 ms, flip angle 7°, 256 × 256 matrix, 176 sagittal slices, 1-mm3 resolution). Whole-brain functional data were acquired with T2*-weighted EPI sequence sensitive to the BOLD contrast (TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, flip angle 90, 64 × 64 matrix, 35 axial slices, slice thickness 4 mm, 3 × 3 mm in plane resolution). 

A total of 712 whole-brain EPI volumes were thus acquired for each movie viewing. The number of whole-brain EPI volumes for the moral dilemma decision task varied individually depending on the decision made by each subject (median 267 whole-brain EPI volumes). Heart pulse and respiration were monitored with the Biopac system (Biopac Systems Inc., Isla Vista, California, USA) during fMRI. Instantaneous values of heart rate and breathing rate were estimated with Drifter software package  (  http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/drifter/  ). 


### fMRI preprocessing 
  
Standard fMRI preprocessing steps were applied using the FSL software (  www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk  ) and custom MATLAB code (available at   https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/BML/bramila/  ). Briefly, EPI images were corrected for head motion using MCFLIRT. 

Then they were coregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute 152 2 mm template in a two-step registration procedure using FLIRT: from EPI to subject’s anatomical image after brain extraction (9 degrees of freedom) and from anatomical to standard template (12 degrees of freedom). Further, spatial smoothing was applied with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum. High pass temporal filter at a cut-off frequency of 0.01 Hz was used to remove scanner drift. To further control for motion and physiological artefacts, BOLD time series were cleaned using 24 motion-related regressors, signal from deep white matter, ventricles and cerebral spinal fluid locations (see ) for details, cerebral spinal fluid mask from SPM8 file csf.nii, white matter and ventricles masks from Harvard Oxford atlas included with FSL). As a measure of quality control we computed framewise displacement to quantify instantaneous head motion. Out of all the 120 runs (30 subjects, 4 sessions each), 97.5% of the runs (117 runs) had 90% of time points (640 volumes) with framewise displacement under the 0.5 mm threshold suggested in . For the remaining three runs, the number of time points under 0.5 mm were 639 (89.7%), 633 (88.9%), 489 (68.7%), i.e. only one session had a considerable amount of head motion. While head motion is a concern in connectivity studies as it can increase spurious BOLD time series correlations that are affected by the same amount of instantaneous head motion, with across-brain time series correlation, head motion is expected to reduce the SNR. However, to make sure that head motion similarity did not explain any group difference, we computed the same permutation test for the ISC also for average framewise displacement by estimating the similarity of two subjects as the distance between their average framewise displacement value. We found that similarity in average head motion was not different between the two viewing conditions (t-value = 0.255; p = 0.398 obtained with 5000 permutations). 


### Inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis of brain activity during movie watching 
  
To investigate how similar the brain activity was across subjects in the different experimental conditions, we performed inter-subject correlation (ISC) using the isc-toolbox (  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/isc-toolbox/  ) . For each voxel the toolbox computes a similarity matrix between subject pairs and within same subject in all conditions, with the conditions being: (i) shared assumption that the movie’s sisters are genetically related, (ii) shared assumption that the younger sister was adopted, (iii) shared perspective of the to-be-organ-donor, and (iv) shared perspective of the to-be-organ-recipient. The total size of the similarity matrix is then 120 × 120 (4 conditions × 30 subjects) with each subject having two viewings for the genetic and two viewings for the non-genetic condition. The comparison between the conditions of the sisters to be perceived as either genetic sisters or non-genetic sisters results thus in a total of 1740 pairs per condition, as the similarity of BOLD time series during the two viewings (in either the genetic or the non-genetic condition) of each subject is compared with the two respective viewings of the other N-1 subjects. As the order of subjects does not matter, the final number of pairs in same conditions will be 2*2*(N-1)*N/2 = 1740 with N = 30. Each value of the correlation matrix is a result of the correlation between the BOLD time series of the pair of subjects considered for the selected voxel. We computed differences between experimental conditions by first transforming the correlation values into z-scores with the Fisher Z transform and then computing t-values and corresponding p-values using a permutation based approach . 

The Fisher-Z transformed correlations of the two perspectives were pooled for either the genetic or the non-genetic sisterhood. 

Correction for the multiple comparison was performed with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) correction at a q &lt; 0.05, corresponding to a t-value threshold of 2.133. For visualization purposes, all results were also cluster corrected by removing any significant cluster smaller than 4 × 4 × 4 voxels. Summary tables were generated with an increased t-value threshold of 3. For the conjunction or “intersection–union test”  the p values of the ISC and GLM results are pulled together by considering the maximum p-value at each voxel. Then, multiple comparisons correction is performed with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure with an FDR threshold equal to q &lt; 0.05. 

Unthresholded statistical parametric maps can be found in neurovault:   http://neurovault.org/collections/WGSQZWPH/  . 

#### Perspective taking 
  
In the movie-viewing experiment, in addition to having the subjects to watch the movie in the conditions of sisters related by birth or by adoption, we had altogether four runs, so that on two of the runs the subjects were asked to view the movie from the perspective of the sister who was expected to donate the organ, and on two of the runs from the perspective of the to-be-recipient sister. Thus, there was one run wherein the subjects viewed the movie from the perspective of the to-be- donor thinking that the sisters were genetic, one run wherein the subjects viewed the movie from the perspective of the to-be- donor thinking that the sisters were non-genetic, one run wherein the subjects viewed the movie from the perspective of the to-be- recipient thinking that the sisters were genetic, and one run wherein the subjects viewed the movie from the perspective of the to-be- recipient thinking that the sisters were non-genetic. 

As the results of this task open up a completely other aspect of the experiment with various results to discuss, which go beyond the scope and the space limitation of this article, they will be reported separately elsewhere. These conditions are mentioned here for reasons of describing the experimental procedures thoroughly so that it would be possible for others to replicate the study should they wish to do so. 



### General linear model analysis of the fMRI data acquired during the control task 
  
A moral dilemma decision task was performed by all subjects to localize regions involved in moral processing. The moral dilemma decision task was analyzed with a general linear model approach using the SPM12 software (  www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm  ). To distinguish between moments of decision in the moral dilemma and the simple perception of the presentation, we created a temporal model of the occurrence of decision moments during the experiment. The decision regressor included time points from the revelation of the identity of involved individuals to the moment of decision indicated by button press. The activity during these time points was compared to the activity in all other time points of the task, including telling the background story of the moral dilemma in the presentation. Regressors were convolved with canonical hemodynamic response function to account for hemodynamic lag. From the preprocessed input data (see above) low-frequency signal drifts were removed by high-pass filtering (cutoff 128 s). First, individual contrast images were generated for the main effects of the regressors, then first level analyses were subjected to second-level analyses in MATLAB using one-sample   t  -test to test which brain areas showed significant activations in decision vs. no decision moments in a one-sample   t  -test over subjects. Statistical threshold was set at   p   &lt; 0.05 (cluster-corrected using the threshold free cluster enhancement approach implemented by FSL randomize with 5000 permutations). 


### Recording of eye-movements 
  
Eye movements were recorded during fMRI scanning from all subjects with an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; sampling rate 1000 Hz, spatial accuracy better than 0.5°, with a 0.01° resolution in the pupil-tracking mode). Due to technical problems, 4 subjects had to be excluded from the final data analysis (with the rejection criteria of blinks maximum 10% of the duration of the scan and majority of blinks and saccades less than 1 second in duration). In addition, a part of recordings from some additional subjects had to de discarded due to the same criteria mentioned above, resulting in 61 recorded files with sufficient quality, with 35 files remaining in the genetic condition and 26 remaining files for the non-genetic condition. Prior to the experiment the eye tracker was calibrated once with a nine-point calibration. 

Saccade detection was performed using a velocity threshold of 30°/s and an acceleration threshold of 4000°/s2. Because the experiment was relatively long and no intermediate drift correction was performed, we retrospectively corrected the mean effect of the drift. We first calculated the mean of all fixation locations over the entire experiment for each subject, and then rigidly shifted the fixation distributions so that the mean fixation location coincided with the grand mean fixation location over all subjects. 


### Eye-movement analysis 
  
Subject-wise gaze fixation distributions were compared across the genetic vs. non-genetic conditions in the movie viewing task. Individual heat maps were generated by modelling each fixation as a Gaussian function using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 1degree of visual angle and a radius of 3 standard deviations. The heat maps were generated in time windows of 2 seconds corresponding to the TR used in the fMRI measurements. Spatial similarities between each pair of heat maps across the eye-tracking sessions were calculated using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (inter-subject correlation of eye gaze, eyeISC ). In the end a similarity matrix was obtained with correlations between each pair for each of the 712 time windows. 

First, the mean eISC scores over all 712 time windows were examined. These mean scores were acquired by extracting the mean of Fisher’s Z-transformed correlation scores and then transforming these mean values back to the correlation scale before the statistical analysis. The statistical significance of the group differences was analysed by contrasting pairs in which both subjects assumed a genetic relationship with pairs in which both subjects assumed the younger sister to be adopted. Non-parametric permutation tests with a total of 100000 permutations were used to avoid making assumptions about the data distribution. In this procedure the data were mixed randomly to change groupings and differences in the resulting new randomised groups were used to form an estimated distribution of the data. A comparison of how many of the permuted random partitions into groups build a more extreme group mean difference that the one observed with the original grouping yielded the final p-values. 


### Behavioral Measurements and Self-reports 
  
#### Valence and Arousal measurements 
  
The subjects self-reported emotions they had experienced during movie viewing. This was carried out after the fMRI experiment by viewing the movie again (Full procedures have been described in an earlier publication ). Two aspects of emotional experience were rated: emotional valence (positive-negative scale) and arousal which were acquired on separate runs. While watching the movie in the middle of the screen, the subjects could move a small cursor on the right side of the screen up and down on a scale using the computer mouse to report their current state of valence or arousal using a web tool   https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/eglerean/dynamicannotations  . The self-ratings were collected at 5 Hz sampling rate. 


#### Behavioral questionnaires 
  
The subjects were asked after the first fMRI session five short freeform questions about their perception of the movie, specifically about how easy it was to take one or the other perspective, and whether they would have donated their kidney if in place of the movie protagonist. After the second fMRI session all subjects were debriefed by showing them the ending of the original movie, where it is revealed that the sick sister had wished for the healthy sister to refuse donating her kidney. Afterwards they were asked if seeing the real ending changed their opinion on the roles of the two movie protagonists. 

As an additional self-report measure, the subjects’ disposition for catching emotions from others was assessed with two emotional empathy questionnaires: Hatfield’s Emotional Contagion Scale  and the BIS/BAS scale . Every subject also filled in a questionnaire quantifying their social network , including their emotional closeness to their sister and best friend. The names of the sister and best friend were obtained from this questionnaire for the moral dilemma task. 



### Analysis of behavioral measurements 
  
#### Valence and arousal measurements 
  
To test whether dynamic valence and arousal were different between the genetic and non-genetic condition, we first computed inter-subject similarity matrices using valence and arousal rating time-series. These were compared against a similarity matrix for the experimental conditions of the viewing preceding the valence/arousal rating, i.e. the model tests for the case where individuals are more similar within the same condition (genetic or non-genetic), but dissimilar between conditions. Tests were performed using Mantel test with 5000 permutations. We also performed a test to see if subjects who were rating arousal and valence for the genetic condition had a stronger group similarity than subjects who rated arousal and valence for the non-genetic condition. Tests were performed using permutation based t-tests. As dynamic ratings can also be different in specific time points, we also performed a permutation-based t-test on valence and arousal values at each time point corrected for multiple comparisons across time. 


#### Heart rate and breathing rate analysis 
  
Differences between experimental conditions were computed in the same way as in the ISC analysis: Correlation values were first transformed into z-scores with the Fisher Z’s transform and then a permutation based approach was used to compute t-values and corresponding p-values . Correction for the multiple comparisons was performed with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) correction at a q &lt; 0.05, corresponding to a t-value threshold of 2.133. 



### Behavioral measurements with a new group of subjects 
  
Subsequent to the fMRI experiments a new group of 30 subjects (all female, and having a sister, 18–33 years, mean age 25.5 years, right handed) were recruited for two further behavioral measurements. The subjects first performed an implicit association test (IAT). The IAT measures attitudes and beliefs that might not be consciously self-recognized by the subject or attitudes that the subjects are unwilling to report. By asking the subjects to sort, as quickly as possible, positively and negatively connoted words into categories, the IAT can measure the reaction times of the association process between the categories and the evaluations (e.g., good, bad). It has been shown in previous studies that making a response is easier and thus faster if the category is matching the implicit evaluation the subject bears in mind . In this study the two categories were “genetic sister” (sisko) and “adopted sister” (adoptiosisko). The two categories were paired in different randomized runs with positive or negative words, thus the experiment comprised separate runs asking the subjects to either match the positive words with the category “genetic sister” and negative words with the category “adopted sister” or vice versa to match positive words with the category “adopted sister” and negative words with the category “genetic sister”. The order in which the runs are presented counter-balanced across subjects and categories switched their localization on the screen in different runs to be on the left or right side of the screen to the same extent. Subjects were asked to press a key with either the right or the left hand and thus assign the evaluation word to one category on either the left or right hand side of the computer screen. With the experiment going on, the number of trials in this part of the IAT is increased in order to minimize the effects of practice. The IAT score is based on how long it takes a person to sort the words with the condition associating positive words and genetic (and negative and adopted) in contrast to negative words and genetic (and positive words and adopted). If an implicit preference exist for one of the categories subjects would be faster to match positive words to that category relative to the reverse. Data were analysed using Matlab. Similarity between subjects’ scores were examined TOST testing . As a second task, reaction times for the moral decision task were measured with the same group of subjects that underwent the IAT. As a difference to the decision task performed during fMRI scanning the order of the decisions was randomized (with easy decision including only strangers and difficult decisions including the sister on one side and the friend on the other). Reaction times were measured as the time between the onset of the slide revealing the identity of the involved individuals and the button press of the subject that related her decision. 


### Data availability 
  
The data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author MBT. The data are not publicly available due to a prohibition by the Finnish law: Juridical restrictions set by the Finnish law prevent public access to the collected data, be it anonymized or non-anonymized, when data are recorded from human individuals. As the consent given by the subjects only applies to the specific study reported in our manuscript, no portion of the data collected could be used or released for use by third parties.</pre></details></details>

Social cognition is a term used for several high-level cognitive functions that determine human behaviour in a social context. Several studies showed impairments of social cognition in frontal lobe epilepsies (FLE), such as Theory-of-Mind/mentalizing and facial emotion recognition [ ], as well as neuropsychiatric co-morbidities [ ], but studies quantifying social behaviour abnormalities of FLE patients in an experimental sense are scarce. Even though behaviour relies on cognitive functions, the relationship between cognition, behaviour and epilepsy variables is complex and not fully understood [ ], making it difficult to predict the impact of altered social cognition on social behaviour, and more specifically, therapy adherence in FLE. 

In neuroeconomics—the science of studying research questions in economics through the application of neuroscientific methods and theories—pro-social behaviours, such as trust or cooperation, have been extensively studied for decades, mainly through game paradigms, such as the trust game or the prisoners&#x27; dilemma game [ ]. Using this approach, several brain areas were found to play a role in pro-social behaviour of healthy humans. Crucial parts of this brain network reside in the frontal cortex such as the ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex [ ]. These discoveries have led to the adoption of economic methodology to study behaviour in neurology [ ], but to the best of our knowledge, no such study has focused on the behaviour of patients with epilepsy. 

Adherence to anti-epileptic drug therapy is critical for effective disease management. Although its measurement is difficult without a single method that has yet proved to be the gold standard [ ], therapy adherence of patients suffering from epilepsy is low (at about 30–50%) [ ]. This is unfortunate, as low therapy adherence not only leads to poorer seizure control, but also increases the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy [ ]. The reasons for low therapy adherence in general are still a matter of research [ ]. Low therapy adherence seems to have a multifactorial origin with some factors being associated with neuropsychological impairments and psychiatric co-morbidities of chronic diseases [ ], and others reflecting pathophysiological changes of neural networks specifically affected in epilepsy [ ]. 

We thus designed a study combining conventional neuropsychological with neuroeconomic methods to address the following open research questions:
   
Is there a difference in social behaviour between FLE patients and healthy controls that can be experimentally operationalized? 
  
If such a difference exists, is it associated with altered social cognitive functions and their underlying frontal lobe network? 
  
Does social behaviour affect therapy adherence in FLE? 
  


## Methods 
  
### Subjects 
  
We included 15 FLE patients and 15 healthy controls. We established the following inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the feasibility of the study and avoid known confounders in behavioural research. 

Inclusion criteria for patients were: age between 18 and 50, right-handedness (Edinburgh handedness inventory; [ ]), no significant anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms as assessed by a hospital anxiety and depression scale score (HADS) less than 10 [ ] and an obsessive compulsive inventory score (OCIS) less than 40 [ ], sufficient language skills, and a diagnosis of FLE. The latter was based either upon association between typical frontal lobe seizure semiology and existence of an epileptogenic MRI lesion within the frontal lobe or upon direct recording of seizures of frontal lobe origin during a long-term video-EEG monitoring performed in the Department of Functional Neurology and Epileptology at Hospices Civils de Lyon, France, in patients with normal MRI. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, non-MRI suitable transplants, major perceptive impairments, non-epileptic seizures, a history of intellectual disability, other known neurological diseases, MRI-lesion outside of the frontal lobe or frontal cortical lesions larger than 1 cm in diameter, and past epilepsy or other brain surgery in order to achieve a patient sample of non-resected participants. 

Inclusion criteria for controls were: age between 18 and 50, right-handedness (Edinburgh handedness inventory; [ ]), no significant anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms assessed by a HADS Score less than 10 [ ] and an OCIS less than 40 [ ] as well as sufficient language skills. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, non-MRI suitable transplants, major perceptive impairments, medication other than contraceptives, or a history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. 


### Magnetic resonance data acquisition 
  
All images were acquired using the same MRI machine (Siemens Magneton Prisma 3 Tesla) in one session per participant. Structural MRI and shimming (to minimize field inhomogeneities) were performed on all subjects prior to gradient-echo echoplanar imaging that provided blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Each volume comprised 35 AC-PC aligned slices (order of acquisition: interleaved) with a thickness of 2.5 cm, field of view (FOV) 23 cm, parallel imaging parameters GRAPPA/acceleration factor 2, echo time (TE) 26 ms, repetition time (TR) 2260 ms. 


### Paradigm 
  
We designed our paradigm on the basis of similar experiments in the literature [ ] to ensure comparability. When subjects entered the laboratory for the experiment, they received written instructions explaining the prisoners&#x27; dilemma game (PDG) [ ]. In this game, two players decide at the same time whether or not to cooperate with the other player. Depending on the decisions of both players, there is a monetary pay-off, which is equal for both players in the case of mutual cooperation or defection, whereas in the case of divergent strategies, it is not existent for the cooperating player and highest for the defecting player. The pay-off structure of our version of the game is shown in  .

Participants were told that they would play with real money and be paid out their gain. Payment took place at the end of the experiment, but in fact, all participants received the same amount of money (40€) independent of their actual gain due to ethical considerations. The participants did not know the number of rounds played in the game, but in fact all subjects played 32 rounds. Moreover, participants (player 1) were told that they would be playing with four different human beings (two males and two females—here termed player 2) located in another room, but actually played against a computer-generated, randomized, strategy that simulated the other player&#x27;s behaviour. This means that each participant played 32 rounds with each of the four different counterparts (equals 128 decisions to cooperate or to defect in total). Player 2 was illustrated with face images from an established database (Glasgow Unfamiliar Face Database). Once installed in the MRI machine, participants first had to rate the trustworthiness of the presented player 2 on a Likert-scale between 1 and 7 (1 no trustworthiness, 7 highest possible trustworthiness) being shown a face picture of player 2. Next, the actual game began. Each round of the game consisted of 3 screens: first, the pay-off matrix of the game was shown for 2 s. Then, participants were asked to choose to either cooperate or to defect using two input buttons. After a random time interval between 4 and 6 s simulating variable decision times of player 2, the result of the round was shown for 2 s using the pay-off matrix with the result highlighted in yellow colour. After 32 rounds of the game, the face of player 2 was again shown to the participants, who had to rate the trustworthiness of the face another time in analogy to the start. Finally, the overall gain of the game was shown. See   for a visualization.

### Demographic data, neuropsychological testing, questionnaires and pill counts 
  
We recorded the following variables in all participants via a self-report questionnaire: age, gender, profession and education. For patients, we included the number of seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures and other seizure types separately) in the last three months according to a seizure calendar commonly used in clinical routine and current anticonvulsive treatment (number and names of drugs, number of intakes per day, preparation of drugs for intake by the participant or by a carer) as recorded in the patient&#x27;s medical chart. 

Neuropsychological variables captured in all participants included psychomotor speed and mental flexibility (Trail Making test A and B [ ]), memory for faces and working memory (Faces subsets and numbers of the Wechsler Memory Scale, fourth edition [ ]). 

Social cognition was tested through the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test [ ] for Theory-of-Mind/mentalizing (in this test, subjects have to choose the correct word out of a list describing emotions to corresponding photos of a person&#x27;s expression of eyes) and a trust questionnaire ([ ]; French version), additionally to the trustworthiness ratings of faces during the fMRI paradigm. 

Furthermore, therapy adherence was measured in the patient group through pill counts at two consecutive visits [ ] by reviewing pill bottles of a six months period and several questionnaires comprising the Morisky adherence scale ([ , ]; validated French version), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ; [ , ]; validated French version) and the SATMED-Q (Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire, [ ]; French version). These questionnaires are commonly used instruments in research on therapy adherence. 


### Data analysis 
  
#### Imaging data 
  
fMRI data were analysed using SPM 12 ( ). Pre-processing involved slice time correction, realignment, normalization and smoothing with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. A general linear model with two conditions (decision phase and result phase) was estimated. No subject had to be excluded. The contrast images calculated for individual subjects were entered into a second level or random effects analysis [ ]. We first calculated   t  -tests for the two conditions (decision/result) for all participants as one group and in a second step analysed each group (patients/controls) separately in the same way. In a third step, we calculated two-sample   t  -tests between the two groups for both conditions. We then implemented a 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA using a flexible factorial design with the factors ‘group&#x27; (patients/controls) and ‘condition&#x27; (decision/result) to calculate main effects of group and condition as well as the interaction effect of group and condition. The resultant statistical parametric maps were thresholded using an FWE-corrected   p  -value threshold less than 0.001, reporting clusters greater than 20 voxels (  k   = 20) only. Anatomical structures of cluster maxima were labelled in Talairach space using the Talairach Client ( ). 

Based on the previous research, we   a priori   selected the following regions of interest (ROIs) for further analyses: superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri, medial and lateral orbital gyri, posterior orbital gyrus, straight gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, thalamus and caudate nucleus. We used adult brain maximum probability maps (© Copyright Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine 2007. All rights reserved) to obtain the ROIs [ ]. 

In a subsequent step, we computed the % of BOLD signal change extracted from beta images from significant voxels from the second-level analysis within an 8 mm sphere surrounding the activation peak and calculated correlations with all other variables collected during the study. 


#### Neuropsychological and questionnaire data 
  
The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS, v. 20 and involved two-tailed, non-parametric testing (Wilcoxon test,   χ  ²-test), as well as Spearman&#x27;s rho correlations. We corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni–Holm procedure and chose a significance level of less than 0.05. 




## Results 
  
### Behavioural data, neuropsychological variables and questionnaires 
  
We included 15 FLE patients and 15 healthy controls. Four patients (26.67%) were seizure free, while the remaining eleven (73.33%) had a median monthly seizure frequency of 4 during a three-month period preceding the experiment. MRI was normal in nine patients (60%) and showed frontal lobe lesions—cavernoma (one patient), focal cortical dysplasia (one patient), diffuse axonal trauma (one patient), and post-haematoma scars (two patients)—in the remaining five patients (33.3%). The remaining patient had undergone skull (but not brain) surgery in childhood for craniostenosis and the current structural MRI showed no obvious pathological changes. Three patients were on monotherapy and 12 patients were under polytherapy (mean number ± s.d. of anti-epileptic drugs: 2.33 ± 0.98). Mean ± s.d. subjective (Morisky adherence scale) and objective (pill counts) measures of treatment adherence during a six-month period were 1.73 ± 0.88 (range: 0–8, lower number indicates higher adherence) and 7.00 ± 12.45 (number of prescribed pills not taken), indicating moderate level of adherence. Patients also showed high belief of treatment necessity (BMQ mean ± s.d.—necessity 21.13 ± 6.30, range: 5–25), average level of concerns and negative views regarding therapy (BMQ: concerns and harms 24.87 ± 9.36, range: 9–45; overuse 7.47 ± 3.27, range: 4–20) and an average treatment satisfaction (SATMED-Q mean ± s.d.: 65.36 ± 7.88, range: 17–85). Questionnaires capturing beliefs about medicines (  p   = 0.256), treatment satisfaction (  p   = 0.776), or adherence (  p   = 0.056) did not correlate significantly with therapy adherence measured through pill counts, although the Morisky adherence scale was close to being significant (  p   = 0.056). 

For all demographic, neuropsychological and neuroeconomic data collected in this study on both patient and control groups, please refer to  . In summary, there was no significant difference between the patient and control groups regarding age, gender, handedness, education, professional status, trust in doctors as captured by the respective questionnaire [ ], trustworthiness of game opponents, or working memory for numbers. By contrast, patients demonstrated statistically significant worse performance than controls in mentalizing measured through the Reading eyes in the mind test, memory for faces, psychomotor speed during Trail making test A, and mental flexibility performance during Trail making test B.

Furthermore, there was also a significant difference in the total number of cooperative choices during the PDG, indicating higher cooperation in patients than in controls. The numbers of cooperative choices between games 1 and 4 differed significantly in both groups, indicating that cooperation decreased significantly between the first and the last game of the experiment in both groups ( ).

Mentalizing correlated strongly with memory for faces (  r   = 0.715;   p   = 0.000) and with trust in doctors and the health system [ ] (  r   = 0.437;   p   = 0.026), showing that participants with high mentalizing abilities also better memorized faces and had higher trust in healthcare. Taken together these data supported a positive correlation between several pro-social cognition and behaviour variables. 

There was a significant positive correlation between cooperative choices in the PDG and missed medication intakes with high values representing low therapy adherence (  r   = 0.686;   p   = 0.010), indicating higher cooperative behaviour in patients with low therapy adherence. 


### Imaging results (see tables  ,   and  ) 
  
#### Voxel-based whole brain analysis 
  
 Brain activation during decision-making.   During the decision-making whether to cooperate or defect when playing the PDG, combined event-related fMRI analysis of data from all subjects (one sample   t  -test) showed significantly activated clusters in right inferior parietal lobule, left precuneus, left lingual gyrus, left insula, the middle and inferior frontal gyri bilaterally, left superior frontal gyrus, as well as the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum ( ). In controls, significant activation was observed in the right fusiform gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, left insula and left superior temporal gyrus, while in patients, significant activation was observed in the left superior frontal gyrus, left precuneus, and left insula.

 Brain activation during result phase.   During the perception of the results of the game, combined analysis of data from all subjects (one sample   t  -test) showed activation in the inferior parietal lobules bilaterally and the right middle temporal gyrus—these results are visualized in   as well. In controls, significant activation was observed in the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobules bilaterally, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus. In patients, significant activation was observed in both inferior parietal lobules, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, right thalamus, left insula and right precuneus. 

 Individual group comparisons for both conditions.   Two-sample   t  -tests between the patient and control groups did not yield any significant results for both conditions. 

 Integrated comparison across groups and conditions.   In the full factorial analysis, the main group effect (  F  -test) showed significant clusters in the right and left medial prefrontal cortex—Brodmann area 10 ( ). In the main effect of condition (decision-making versus result phase of the game), the following clusters were significant: right anterior lobe of the cerebellum, left precentral gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, left middle temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. There was no significant interaction between group and condition.

#### Region of interest analysis 
  
ROI analysis (  F  -test) showed differences in activation between the patient and control groups in the right and left superior frontal gyrus, while the   t  -test analyses showed no significant differences. The mean % of BOLD signal changes in these ROIs in the result condition showed a significant negative correlation with initial trust (  r   = −0.448;   p   = 0.017), indicating that participants with high initial trust showed lower signal change in these brain areas during result perception. The mean % of BOLD signal changes in the choice condition also correlated significantly with differences between the initial and final trust (  r   = −0.618;   p   = 0.000; first ROI and   r   = −0.545;   p   = 0.003 for the second ROI), meaning that participants with a high decrease of trust from the beginning to the end of the games showed lower signal changes while making their choices in the game. 

Another significant correlation was detected between therapy adherence and the % BOLD signal change in the choice condition (  r   = 0.565;   p   = 0.044 for the first ROI) showing that participants with low therapy adherence had higher signal changes in this brain area. 




## Discussion 
  
In this study, we first confirmed that mentalizing is impaired in patients with FLE, as previously established [ ]. These abnormalities correlated with an altered memory for faces, a previously unreported finding in FLE, which may shed light on the mechanisms underlying dysfunction in social behaviour. Interestingly, there is evidence of frontal lobe contributions to memory for faces [ ]. Furthermore, mentalizing abilities correlated with the results of the trust in healthcare questionnaire implying an overall good correlation of pro-social cognition variables in our study. 

One of the goals of this study was to find out whether deficits in social cognition in FLE patients could lead to differences in social behaviour that can be operationalized. In fact, we showed that FLE patients behave differently from healthy controls in the PDG, but in a counterintuitive way, since they cooperated more than controls. While this finding was unexpected, we observed a frequent pattern of evolving cooperation during the game in both the patients&#x27; and controls&#x27; groups, with higher rates of cooperation in early game phases and less cooperative behaviour in the later ones [ ]. This strategy is consistent with the objective of maximizing profit. Indeed, future possible interactions encourage people to cooperate in the early phases of the game, with the hope to initiate a mutually cooperative relationship. If not reciprocated, strategy will later shift to defection in players who want to maximize their own profit [ ]. 

In this context, higher cooperation in patients might result from impaired negative feedback when cooperative behaviour is not reciprocated, especially because the ability to shift behaviour from cooperation to defection in such a case is dependent on frontal lobe functions [ ]. Alternatively, patients&#x27; behaviour could be interpreted as a preference for higher delayed rewards since higher cooperation leads to higher future profits [ ]. Although evidence on time preference for rewards (also referred to as ‘delay discounting&#x27;) in neurological patients is scarce, altered delay discounting as another behavioural symptom of neurological disorders was reported before [ ]. 

Prior functional brain imaging studies investigating cooperative behaviour through the PDG found, in essence, three brain networks to be active during the game: several frontal brain areas, especially the medial prefrontal cortex, as well as reward and limbic brain regions [ ] reflecting the cognitive functions necessary to successfully play the game, such as decision-making and reward-based learning. Our analyses of brain activation of all participants showed a similar pattern of brain areas to be active during the game. However, when looking at the patient and control group separately, controls, but not patients showed significant activation in several temporal regions during decision-making whether to cooperate or not. Interestingly, those regions have been implicated in both Theory-of-Mind and facial processing tasks (e.g. [ ]) and thus further substantiate our behavioural results of higher mentalizing and face memory abilities in the control group. During the perception of the results during the game, the cingulate gyrus, a region thought to be active in situations of cognitive conflict [ ], was significantly activated in controls, but not in patients. When opponents in an economic game do not reciprocate benevolent behaviour, this is perceived as a conflict between economic self-interest (i.e. rationality) and fairness considerations [ ]. Hypothetically, patients might have not perceived cognitive conflicts to the same extent as controls in such game results, which might also have led to higher cooperative behaviour. 

When comparing our functional imaging results between the patient and control groups on both whole-brain and ROI level, it becomes apparent that the activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) differed significantly between the two groups during the game. The MPFC plays a pivotal role in social behaviour and decision-making [ , ], which is reflected in our results of correlating MPFC activation changes and face trustworthiness evaluations, although those have been based upon a low number of data points only. Therefore, a difference in MPFC activation between two groups showing such divergent cooperative behaviour seems plausible. Our fMRI findings do not allow us to infer the directionality of the observed difference in activation, potentially because of either the difference being based on both conditions rather than differences in activation during the individual conditions, the   t  -test comparisons between groups being underpowered, and/or the difference in activation between the groups not being sufficiently strong to pass the set threshold in the   t  -test analyses. Although a pathology-driven lower activation might seem more plausible, a compensatory higher activation is also possible [ ]. Further imaging studies are needed to address this question. 

Another goal of our study was to investigate possible links between cooperative behaviour and therapy adherence in FLE. Our results show that cooperative behaviour in the PDG correlated negatively with therapy adherence in patients (high cooperative behaviour correlating with low therapy adherence). Even though we could not find any previous literature on the relationship between cooperative behaviour and therapy adherence, there is some evidence that decision-making, in general, has effects on therapy adherence with lower decision-making skills leading to lower adherence [ ]. As we have outlined before, higher cooperation can be interpreted as lower social decision-making abilities in the context of our experiment. Thus, the inverse relation between therapy adherence and cooperative behaviour actually fits into the current scientific framework on the interaction of behaviour, decision-making and therapy adherence. Importantly, there was no correlation between questionnaire data about therapy adherence and pill counts in our study, reflecting the known difficulties in measuring adherence in epilepsy (e.g. [ ]). Moreover, the MPFC activation during the game showed a correlation with therapy adherence reflecting the close link between social cognition and therapy adherence. 

We acknowledge that our study design of comparing people with FLE to healthy controls does not allow distinguishing whether the study findings apply solely to FLE or to epilepsy in general. Looking at the published literature on other epilepsy syndromes with frontal lobe dysfunction, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or genetic generalized epilepsies, it becomes apparent that patients with these types of epilepsies also show abnormalities in social functions such as Theory-of-Mind [ , ]. In our view, neuroeconomic methodology could help us to determine the behavioural consequences of these social cognitive impairments. Further studies comparing cooperative behaviour and therapy adherence between FLE and other epileptic disorders are therefore warranted. 


## Conclusion 
  
To conclude, our results implicate that (i) social behaviour is affected by FLE and (ii) can be measured using neuroeconomic methods. Impaired social behaviour in FLE might (iii) be a consequence of differing MPFC activation and (iv) might play a role in low therapy adherence. This is important as therapy adherence is difficult to measure, especially in patients with epilepsy where classical tools of measurement (e.g. questionnaires or electronic devices) have been shown to be imprecise [ ]. Integrating neuroeconomic testing of social behaviour into the neuropsychological testing routine could help to better understand therapy adherence of patients with epilepsies and consequently help to improve patient care through an identification of patients at risk.
