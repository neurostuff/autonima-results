# Mixed/Incorrect Adjudication with Pubget + ACE Evidence

_Generated: 2026-02-20T15:16:43_

## Scope
- Target set: studies categorized as `mixed` or `all_incorrect` in `match_results_overall.json`.
- Evidence source priority: `pubget` (when PMCID available) else `ace`.
- Balanced adjudication policy: manual is a strong prior, but parser/extraction evidence can overturn on clear contrary evidence.

## Coverage and Validation
- Mixed + All Incorrect PMIDs: **35**
- Pubget-backed PMIDs: **2**
- ACE fallback PMIDs: **33**
- No-study gaps after fallback: **0**
- Source assignment violations: **0**
- Evidence completeness violations: **0**

## Adjudication Outcome Summary
- `true_failure`: **17**
- `likely_human_deficiency`: **6**
- `ambiguous`: **12**

## Parser Prompt Constraints (for traceability)
- Source: `autonima/autonima/coordinates/processor.py`
- `processor.py:118`: Coordinates **must come ONLY from the X, Y, Z columns**
- `processor.py:125`: Start a new analysis whenever a distinct label is present
- `processor.py:126`: If no explicit contrasts, treat the whole table as a single analysis
- `processor.py:127`: Use only names that explicitly appear in the provided table, caption, or footnotes

## Failure Mode Counts (true_failure only)
- `table_structure_misread`: **13**
- `contrast_overmerge`: **8**
- `generic_labeling`: **2**
- `contrast_oversplit`: **1**
- `coordinate_block_misattribution`: **1**

## Recommended Improvements (mapped to observed tags)
- `table_structure_misread` (n=13): Add table-structure aware parsing (rowspan/colspan/header row levels) before LLM extraction to preserve contrast grouping.
- `contrast_overmerge` (n=8): Strengthen split rules: start a new analysis when subgroup, task block, or directional contrast label changes; do not merge across such boundaries.
- `generic_labeling` (n=2): Require analysis names to include discriminative contrast semantics (condition A vs B, subgroup, directionality), otherwise emit null name and defer to table header hierarchy.
- `contrast_oversplit` (n=1): Strengthen merge rules: keep rows under the same contrast header together unless a new explicit contrast marker appears.
- `coordinate_block_misattribution` (n=1): Constrain coordinate assignment to local contrast blocks and require name+coordinate co-consistency checks before finalizing an analysis.

A number of neuroimaging studies have examined the brain networks for leading and following, but none have examined what effect prior expertise at these roles has on brain activations during joint motor tasks. Couple dancers (e.g., dancers of Tango, Salsa, and swing) are an ideal population in which examine such effects, since leaders and followers; tables=Table 1: Correlation between age, years of couple-dance experience, and self-reported leading and following skill.
