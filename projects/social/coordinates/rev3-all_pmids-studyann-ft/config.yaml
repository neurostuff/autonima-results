    objective: "Identify fMRI studies of social related processing in healthy adults"
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Functional MRI scan conducted while human participants performed a social-related task. Relevant constructs include (but are not limited to) Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others.
      - At least one group of healthy participants, age 18–65, even if other groups include participants with psychiatric or neurological disorders.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - systematic reviews or meta-analyses

    objective: "Identify fMRI studies of social related processing in healthy adults"
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Study uses functional MRI during a social-related task. Relevant constructs include (but are not limited to)- Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others.
      - Sample- At least one group of healthy adult participants (age 18–65). Studies that also include clinical or special groups are eligible only if results for the healthy group are reported separately.
      - Whole-brain evidence- The paper must report at least one group-level, whole-brain (voxelwise) task-evoked statistical map (e.g., main effect or within-group contrast) that is clearly identified as coming from the healthy/control group (i.e., not limited to a narrowly defined subgroup).
      - It is acceptable for qualifying whole-brain results to be reported in tables of coordinates, figures, or supplementary materials, as long as they are clearly described in the text.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - Studies that report only region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with no whole-brain results.
      - Studies that report only seed-based connectivity, effective connectivity (e.g., PPI, DCM), or resting-state analyses (e.g., ICA, PLE, Hurst exponents) without also reporting a healthy-group whole-brain task activation map.
      - Studies that report only between-group contrasts or interactions (e.g., subgroup vs subgroup, patient vs control) without an accompanying unmasked, whole-brain healthy-group task effect.
      - Studies that include only participants outside the age range of 18–65, unless a healthy adult subgroup in this range is analyzed and reported separately.
      - Non-empirical papers (e.g., reviews, meta-analyses, methods-only, simulations) without original fMRI data in healthy adults.

  inclusion_criteria:
    - Sample- The analysis must be on a healthy adult participants (alone, not a clinical or special group, or a comparison between healthy and clinical/special groups).
    - Whole-brain evidence- The analysis must be from a group-level, univariate whole-brain (voxelwise) task-evoked statistical map (e.g., main effect or within-group contrast) that is from the healthy/control group and is generalizable to the healthy adult population.

    - Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses

    - name: "social_processing_all"
      description: "Social Processing encompasses a broad range of processes that enable individuals to perceive, interpret, and respond to social information. This includes understanding social cues, recognizing emotions in others, engaging in social interactions, and forming social bonds. Social processing is fundamental to human behavior and is crucial for effective communication and relationship-building."
      inclusion_criteria:
        - Analyses performed a social-related task. Relevant constructs include (but are not limited to) Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others.
        - "The analysis/contrast must measure Social Processing"
    - name: "affiliation_attachment"
      description: "Affiliation and Attachment is characterized by positive interactions and social bonds, and typically involves the detection of and attention to social cues, as well as social learning associated with the formation of relationships. Assessment measures generally relate to attachment styles, close relationship scales, and parental and peer bonding."
      inclusion_criteria:
        - "Analyses must be on a task measuring affiliation and attachment (example tasks: Kinship-related social scenarios; Cooperation and competition; Social comparison)"
        - "The analysis/contrast must measure Affiliation and Attachment (example contrast: Loved one vs Stranger)"
    - name: "social_communication"
      description: "Social Communication involves the exchange of socially relevant information and involves both receptive (e.g., affect recognition, facial recognition, and characterization) and productive (e.g., eye contact, expressive reciprocation, gaze following) aspects of communication. Within this construct, there exist four subconstructs: (i) Reception of Facial Communication, (ii) Production of Facial Communication, (iii) Reception of Non-Facial Communication, and (iv) Production of Non-Facial Communication. "
      inclusion_criteria:
        - "Analyses from tasks measuring Social Communication (example tasks: Kinship-related social scenarios; Cooperation and competition; Social comparison)"
        - "The analysis/contrast must measure Social Communication (example contrast: Loved one vs Stranger)"
    - name: "perception_self"
      description: "Perception and Understanding of Self includes processes involved in being aware of, accessing knowledge, or making judgments about the self, and can include current cognitive or emotional internal states, traits, and/or abilities, as well as mechanisms that support self-awareness, self-monitoring, and self-knowledge. Within this construct, there exist two subconstructs: (i) Agency and (ii) Self-knowledge. "

    - name: "perception_others"
      description: "Perception and Understanding of Others are the representations involved in being aware of, assessing knowledge about, and reasoning about others’ emotional states, traits, or abilities. Among this construct exist three subconstructs: (i) Animacy Perception, (ii) Action Perception, and (iii) Understanding Mental States."
