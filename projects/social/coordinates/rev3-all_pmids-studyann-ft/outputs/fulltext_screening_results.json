However, it does not report any group-level whole-brain, voxelwise task-evoked statistical maps (or coordinate tables/figures of whole-brain activations). The paper presents ROI-based functional connectivity and graph-theoretical/network analyses using the Power-264 atlas rather than unmasked whole-brain task activation maps for the healthy group. Therefore it fails inclusion criterion I5 and lacks acceptable whole-brain task results (I6 not met). Exclusion applies because results are ROI/network/connectivity-only without whole-brain task activation maps.",
