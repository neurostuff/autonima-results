  abstract:
    model: "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"
    objective: "identify studies reporting structural brain alterations associated with PTSD"
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Written in the English language
      - Peer reviewed MRI studies reporting results among adult humans
      - Reporting on original data
      - Sample- Adult humans. At least one group of individuals with PTSD, must be included the study.
      - Study must report gray matter structural differences (i.e. voxel based morphometry) associated with PTSD
    exclusion_criteria:
      - Non-empirical papers (e.g., reviews, meta-analyses, methods-only, simulations) without original MRI data.
      - Studies only reporting white matter structural differences
    confidence_reporting: true

    objective: "identify studies reporting structural brain alterations comparing the following groups: individuals with PTSD, individuals who experienced trauma but were not diagnosed with PTSD, and individuals who did not report experiencing trauma."
    inclusion_criteria:
      - Study must measure voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter volume or concentration using MRI.
      - Sample- At least one group of individuals with PTSD, and at least one comparison group (either trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD or trauma-unexposed healthy controls) must be included in the study.
      - Whole-brain evidence- The paper must report at least one whole-brain voxel based morphometry (VBM) result, comparing individuals with PTSD to either trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD or trauma-unexposed healthy controls.
      - It is acceptable for qualifying whole-brain results to be reported in tables of coordinates, figures, or supplementary materials, as long as they are clearly described in the text.
    exclusion_criteria:
      - Trauma or stressful life event studies not measuring PTSD
      - Studies that do not report coordinate-based results of at least one between group contrast, comparing individuals with PTSD to either trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD or trauma-unexposed healthy controls.
      - Studies that only report treatment and longitudinal effects
      - Studies that only region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with no whole-brain results, or only within-group effects, or only null effects, or only other non-voxel-based morphometry methods
      - Studies that only include non-adult participants (e.g., children, adolescents, elderly)
