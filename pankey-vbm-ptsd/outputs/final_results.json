      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterised by a range of debilitating psychological, physical and cognitive symptoms. PTSD has been associated with grey matter atrophy in limbic and frontal cortical brain regions. However, previous studies have reported heterogeneous findings, with grey matter changes observed beyond limbic/frontal areas. Seventy-five adults were recruited from the community, 25 diagnosed with PTSD along with 25 healthy and 25 trauma exposed age and gender matched controls. Participants underwent clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The data-analyses method Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) was used to estimate cortical grey matter volumes. When compared to both healthy and trauma exposed controls, PTSD subjects demonstrated decreased grey matter volumes within subcortical brain regions-including the hippocampus and amygdala-along with reductions in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal medial cortex, middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, and precuneus cortex. Significant negative correlations were found between total CAPS lifetime clinical scores/sub-scores and GM volume of both the PTSD and TC groups. GM volumes of the left rACC and right amygdala showed a significant negative correlation within PTSD diagnosed subjects.",

The aim of the present study is to obtain evidence for neuroanatomical difference for these disorders. We applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie to compare gray matter volume (GMV) in magnetic resonance images obtained for 30 patients with PTSD, 29 patients with OCD, 20 patients with SAD, and 30 healthy controls. GMV across all four groups differed in left hypothalamus and left inferior parietal lobule and post hoc analyses revealed that this difference is primarily due to reduced GMV in the PTSD group relative to the other groups. Further analysis revealed that the PTSD group also showed reduced GMV in frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum compared to the OCD group, and reduced GMV in frontal lobes bilaterally compared to SAD group. A significant negative correlation with anxiety symptoms is observed for GMV in left hypothalamus in three disorder groups. We have thus found evidence for brain structure differences that in future could provide biomarkers to potentially support classification of these disorders using MRI.",

      "abstract": "This study compared the difference in brain structure in 12 mine disaster survivors with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, 7 cases of improved post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and 14 controls who experienced the same mine disaster but did not suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, using the voxel-based morphometry method. The correlation between differences in brain structure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was also investigated. Results showed that the gray matter volume was the highest in the trauma control group, followed by the symptoms-improved group, and the lowest in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. Compared with the symptoms-improved group, the gray matter volume in the lingual gyrus of the right occipital lobe was reduced in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. Compared with the trauma control group, the gray matter volume in the right middle occipital gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus was reduced in the symptoms-improved group. Compared with the trauma control group, the gray matter volume in the left superior parietal lobule and right superior frontal gyrus was reduced in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. The gray matter volume in the left superior parietal lobule was significantly positively correlated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory subscale score in the symptoms-improved group and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group (r = 0.477, P = 0.039). Our findings indicate that (1) chronic post-traumatic stress disorder patients have gray matter structural damage in the prefrontal lobe, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe, (2) after post-traumatic stress, the disorder symptoms are improved and gray matter structural damage is reduced, but cannot recover to the trauma-control level, and (3) the superior parietal lobule is possibly associated with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder patients exhibit gray matter abnormalities.",

The current study used functional and structural MRI to examine occipital cortex function and structure in male combat veterans with and without PTSD. Left occipital gray matter volume was reduced in PTSD patients relative to the controls and correlated negatively with the severity of PTSD symptoms. Functional activity in the lateral occipital complex to aversive and nonaversive pictures presented in novel and repeated presentations was not altered by PTSD. These findings suggest that PTSD adversely affects occipital lobe volume but not the reactivity of the lateral occipital complex to generally aversive, trauma nonspecific stimuli.",

The current investigation sought to investigate whether a transdiagnostic set of structural alterations characterized schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and determine whether any such alterations reflected markers of psychiatric illness or pre-existing familial vulnerability. A total of 404 patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were recruited (psychosis, n\u2009=\u2009129; unipolar depression, n\u2009=\u200992; post-traumatic stress disorder, n\u2009=\u200991; obsessive-compulsive disorder, n\u2009=\u200992) alongside n\u2009=\u2009201 healthy controls and n\u2009=\u200920 unaffected first-degree relatives. We collected structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from each participant, and tested for transdiagnostic alterations using Voxel-based morphometry. Inferences were made at p\u2009<\u20090.05 after family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons. The four psychiatric groups relative to healthy controls were all characterized by significantly greater gray matter volume in the putamen (right: z-score: 5.97, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001; left: z-score: 4.97, p-value\u2009=\u20090.001); the volume of this region was positively correlated with severity of symptoms across groups (r\u2009=\u20090.313; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Putamen enlargement was also evident in unaffected relatives compared to healthy controls (right: z-score: 8.13, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001; left: z-score: 9.38, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001). Taken collectively, these findings indicate that increased putamen volume may reflect a transdiagnostic marker of familial vulnerability to psychopathology. This is consistent with emerging conceptualizations of psychiatric illness, in which each disorder is understood as a combination of diagnosis-specific features and a transdiagnostic factor reflecting general psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "To examine the impact of environmental stress on grey matter volume in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we investigated the relationship between duration of PTSD and grey matter volume of hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex. Twenty-one participants with PTSD and 17 trauma-exposed controls, matched for age and sex and with no history of substance dependence, underwent a T1-weighted structural MRI scan and voxel-based morphometry was employed. After controlling for age, depression and whole-brain volume, analysis of covariance revealed significant reductions in hippocampus and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in PTSD, and there was a significant negative correlation between right hippocampal volume and PTSD duration. This pattern suggests that prolonged PTSD may have cumulative adverse effects on hippocampal volume, highlighting the potential role of genetic-environmental interactions.",

Premotor cortical areas are involved in preparing to respond to a threatening situation and in representing the peripersonal space. Urban violence is an important and pervasive cause of human suffering, especially in large urban centers in the developing world. Violent events, such as armed robbery, are very frequent in certain cities, and these episodes increase the risk of PTSD. Assaultive trauma is characterized by forceful invasion of the peripersonal space; therefore, could this traumatic event be associated with structural alteration of premotor areas in PTSD?",

We investigated brain structural alterations and the longitudinal courses in patients with cancer-related PTSD.

Follow-up scans were performed 2 years later in 76 cancer survivors (PTSD, n=9; non-PTSD, n=67). Using voxel-based morphometry, the gray matter volume (GMV) of the cancer survivors with PTSD was compared with the GMVs of those without PTSD and of the healthy subjects. The effects of the interactions between the diagnosis and the timing of the GMV measurements were examined. The GMV of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was significantly smaller in cancer survivors with PTSD than in those without PTSD or healthy subjects. The interaction between the diagnosis and the timing of the right OFC's GMV measurement was not significant. The OFC, which is thought to be involved in the extinction of fear conditioning and the retrieval of emotional memory, might play an important role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Moreover, the OFC's GMV may remain constant after the development of cancer-related PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Prior studies have examined differences in brain volume between patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and control subjects. Convergent findings include smaller hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex volumes in PTSD. However, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) exist on a spectrum, and neural changes may occur beyond the diagnostic threshold of PTSD. We examined the relationship between PTSS and gray matter among combat-exposed U.S. military veterans. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained on 28 combat veterans from Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. PTSS were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Thirteen subjects met criteria for PTSD. Subjects were unmedicated, and free of major comorbid psychiatric disorders. Images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry, and regressed against the total CAPS score and trauma load. Images were subsequently analyzed by diagnosis of PTSD vs. non-PTSD. CAPS scores were inversely correlated with volumes of the subgenual cingulate (sgACC), caudate, hypothalamus, insula, and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Group contrast revealed smaller sgACC, caudate, hypothalamus, left insula, left MTG, and right MFG in the PTSD group. PTSS are associated with abnormalities in limbic structures that may underlie the pathophysiology of PTSD. These abnormalities exist on a continuum with PTSS, beyond a diagnosis of PTSD.",

In the current study, 20 coal mine flood disaster survivors underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and region of interest (ROI) techniques were used to detect the gray matter and white matter volume changes in 10 survivors with recent onset PTSD and 10 survivors without PTSD. The correlation between the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and gray matter density in the ROI was also studied. Compared with survivors without PTSD, survivors with PTSD had significantly decreased gray matter volume and density in left anterior hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral calcarine cortex. The CAPS score correlated negatively with the gray matter density in bilateral calcarine cortex and left hippocampus in coal mine disaster survivors. Our study suggests that the gray matter volume and density of limbic structure decreased in recent onset PTSD patients who were exposed to extreme trauma. PTSD symptom severity was associated with gray matter density in calcarine cortex and hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among other postassault characteristics, self-blame attributions were suggested to play an important role in sexually assaulted individuals' coping and were consistently associated with PTSD in this population. The present study aimed to elucidate the neural underpinnings that may associate self-blame and PTSD in women who experienced sexual assault at adulthood, using structural and resting-state functional MRI. Thirty-eight sexually assaulted women and 24 non-exposed matched controls were studied (mean age: 25\u2009years). Among the sexually assaulted participants, assault-related self-blame was negatively correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) bilaterally in the lingual gyrus and adjacent intracalcarine cortex. GMV in this cluster was also predicted by intrusion symptoms and negative social reactions. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of this cluster with the left anterior temporal fusiform cortex significantly differed between PTSD and non-PTSD sexually assaulted participants, and was inversely correlated with intrusion symptoms and with peritraumatic dissociation. Finally, lingual cluster's GMV and rs-FC with the anterior fusiform mediated the association between self-blame and intrusion symptoms across sexually assaulted participants. These findings link assault-related self-blame, disrupted postassault recovery and the neural circuitry involved in the processing of traumatic memories.",

      "abstract": "A significant portion of previously deployed combat Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) are affected by comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Despite this fact, neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of cognitive dysfunction within this population are almost nonexistent, with the exception of research examining the neural correlates of diagnostic PTSD or TBI. The current study used both voxel-based and surface-based morphometry to determine whether comorbid PTSD/mTBI is characterized by altered brain structure in the same regions as observed in singular diagnostic PTSD or TBI. Furthermore, we assessed whether alterations in brain structures in these regions were associated with behavioral measures related to inhibitory control, as assessed by the Go/No-go task, self-reports of impulsivity, and/or PTSD or mTBI symptoms. Results indicate volumetric reductions in the bilateral anterior amygdala in our comorbid PTSD/mTBI sample as compared to a control sample of OEF/OIF Veterans with no history of mTBI and/or PTSD. Moreover, increased volume reduction in the amygdala predicted poorer inhibitory control as measured by performance on the Go/No-go task, increased self-reported impulsivity, and greater symptoms associated with PTSD. These findings suggest that alterations in brain anatomy in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with comorbid PTSD/mTBI are associated with both cognitive deficits and trauma symptoms related to PTSD.",

In the current study, we used VBM to examine possible cerebral gray matter abnormalities in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to fire. The subjects included 12 victims of a fire disaster with PTSD and 12 matched victims of the same fire without PTSD. Magnetic resonance images were obtained on a 1.5-Tesla General Electric scanner at Central South University, and an entire brain volume of 248 contiguous slices was obtained for each subject. Then, gray matter density in patients with PTSD and control groups was compared by using a VBM approach in SPM2. Group analysis was thresholded at P<0.001, uncorrected, at the voxel level. The following three regions of reduced gray matter volume were found in patients with PTSD compared with controls: left hippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral insular cortex. It was concluded that there are structural abnormalities of the hippocampus, the ACC and the insular cortex in patients with PTSD due to fire.",

      "abstract": "A number of MRI studies have shown focal or diffuse cortical gray matter (GM) abnormalities in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the results of these studies are unclear regarding the cortical regions involved in this condition, perhaps due to the heterogeneity of the PTSD population included or to the differences in the methodology used for the quantification of the brain structures. In this study, we assessed differences in cortical GM volumes between a selected group of 25 drug-naive PTSD patients with history of adulthood trauma and 25 matched non-traumatized controls. Analyses were performed by using two different automated methods: the structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy (SIENAX) and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM), as we trusted that if these complementary techniques provided similar results, it would increase the confidence in the validity of the assessment. Results of SIENAX and VBM analyses similarly showed that cortical GM volume decreases in PTSD patients when compared to healthy controls, particularly in the frontal and occipital lobes. These decreases seem to correlate with clinical measures. Our findings suggest that in drug-na\u00efve PTSD patients with a history of adulthood trauma, brain structural damage is diffuse, with a particular prevalence for the frontal and occipital lobes, and is clinically relevant.",

      "abstract": "MRI studies using the manual tracing method have shown a smaller-than-normal hippocampal volume in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these studies have yielded inconsistent results, and brain structures other than the hippocampus have not been well investigated. A recently developed, fully automated method called voxel-based morphometry enables an exploration of structural changes throughout the brain by applying statistical parametric mapping to high-resolution MRI. Here we first used this technology in patients with PTSD. Participants were 9 victims of the Tokyo subway sarin attack with PTSD and 16 matched victims of the same traumatic event without PTSD. The voxel-based morphometry showed a significant gray-matter volume reduction in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in trauma survivors with PTSD compared with those without PTSD. The severity of the disorder was negatively correlated with the gray-matter volume of the left ACC in PTSD subjects. There were no significant differences in other gray-matter regions or any of the white-matter regions between two groups. The present study demonstrates evidence for structural abnormalities of ACC in patients with PTSD. Together with previous functional neuroimaging studies showing a dysfunction of this region, the present findings provide further support for the important role of ACC, which is pivotally involved in attention, emotional regulation, and conditioned fear, in the pathology of PTSD.",
