Secondary sampling criterion is also not satisfied for the meta-analysis objective: the PTSD cases are comorbid with BPD (BPD+PTSD), not a PTSD-only group, and contrasts are between BPD subgroups and controls rather than between PTSD-only vs trauma-exposed non-PTSD or trauma-unexposed controls. Therefore it fails to provide the required whole-brain VBM case-control contrasts comparing PTSD to appropriate comparison groups. All other exclusion criteria (adult sample) are met, but the two primary inclusion requirements are not, so the study must be excluded.",
