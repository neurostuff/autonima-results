<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The hippocampus is discussed as one of the key regions in the pathogenesis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). MRI results concerning the volume of the hippocampus are, however, inconsistent. This may be due to the heterogeneity of patients' traumata or postprocessing of the imaging data. To overcome these problems, the present study investigates volume changes in well-characterized chronic PTSD patients in comparison to controls using two different evaluation methods.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous structural magnetic resonance (MR) research in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has found smaller hippocampal volumes in patients compared with control subjects. These studies have mostly involved subjects who have had PTSD for a number of years, such as war veterans or adult survivors of childhood abuse. Patients with recent-onset PTSD have rarely been investigated. To our knowledge only one other study has investigated such a group. The aim of this study was to compare hippocampal volumes of patients with recent onset PTSD and nontrauma-exposed control subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adverse early-life events are predisposing factors for functional neurological disorder (FND) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cingulo-insular regions are implicated in the biology of both conditions and are sites of stress-mediated neuroplasticity. We hypothesised that functional neurological symptoms and the magnitude of childhood abuse would be associated with overlapping anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular volumetric reductions, and that FND and PTSD symptoms would map onto distinct cingulo-insular areas.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deficits in impulse control are increasingly recognized in association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To our further understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD-related disinhibition, we examined alterations in brain morphology and network connectivity associated with response inhibition failures and PTSD severity. The sample consisted of 189 trauma-exposed Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans (89% male, ages 19-62) presenting with a range of current PTSD severity. Disinhibition was measured using commission errors on a Go/No-Go (GNG) task with emotional stimuli, and PTSD was assessed using a measure of current symptom severity. Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses of cortical thickness revealed two clusters associated with PTSD-related disinhibition (Monte Carlo cluster corrected P < 0.05). The first cluster included portions of right inferior and middle frontal gyri and frontal pole. The second cluster spanned portions of left medial orbital frontal, rostral anterior cingulate, and superior frontal gyrus. In both clusters, commission errors were associated with reduced cortical thickness at higher (but not lower) levels of PTSD symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses revealed alterations in the functional connectivity of the right frontal cluster. Together, study findings suggest that reductions in cortical thickness in regions involved in flexible decision-making, emotion regulation, and response inhibition contribute to impulse control deficits in PTSD. Furthermore, aberrant coupling between frontal regions and networks involved in selective attention, memory/learning, and response preparation suggest disruptions in functional connectivity may also play a role.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A significant portion of previously deployed combat Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) are affected by comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Despite this fact, neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of cognitive dysfunction within this population are almost nonexistent, with the exception of research examining the neural correlates of diagnostic PTSD or TBI. The current study used both voxel-based and surface-based morphometry to determine whether comorbid PTSD/mTBI is characterized by altered brain structure in the same regions as observed in singular diagnostic PTSD or TBI. Furthermore, we assessed whether alterations in brain structures in these regions were associated with behavioral measures related to inhibitory control, as assessed by the Go/No-go task, self-reports of impulsivity, and/or PTSD or mTBI symptoms. Results indicate volumetric reductions in the bilateral anterior amygdala in our comorbid PTSD/mTBI sample as compared to a control sample of OEF/OIF Veterans with no history of mTBI and/or PTSD. Moreover, increased volume reduction in the amygdala predicted poorer inhibitory control as measured by performance on the Go/No-go task, increased self-reported impulsivity, and greater symptoms associated with PTSD. These findings suggest that alterations in brain anatomy in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with comorbid PTSD/mTBI are associated with both cognitive deficits and trauma symptoms related to PTSD.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reduced hippocampal volumes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients are thought to reflect specific changes of this structure. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have not consistently examined indices of overall brain atrophy, therefore it cannot be completely ruled out that hippocampal changes are explained by whole-brain atrophy. The purpose of this study was to assess hippocampal and whole-brain volume in civilian PTSD.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Decreased cortical thickness in frontal and temporal regions has been observed in individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to healthy controls and trauma-exposed participants without PTSD. In addition, individual differences, both functional and structural, in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been shown to predict symptom severity reduction. Although there is some evidence suggesting that activity in this region changes as a function of recovery, it remains unknown whether there are any structural correlates of recovery from PTSD.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Preclinical studies show that stress is associated with changes in structure of the hippocampus, a brain area that plays a critical role in memory, inhibition of neurogenesis, and memory deficits. Studies in animals showed that both serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the epilepsy medication phenytoin (dilantin) block the effects of stress on the hippocampus. Imaging studies in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have found smaller volume of the hippocampus as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with PTSD related to both combat and childhood abuse. These patients were also found to have deficits in memory on neuropsychological testing. Functional imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) found decreased hippocampal activation with memory tasks. In an initial study, we found that a year of treatment with paroxetine led to a 5% increase in hippocampal volume and a 35% increase in memory function. A second study showed that phenytoin was efficacious for symptoms of PTSD and led to a significant 6% increase in both right hippocampal and right whole brain volume, with no significant change in memory. These studies suggest that medications may counteract the effects of stress on the brain in patients with PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Studies imposing rigorous control over lifetime alcohol intake usually have not found smaller hippocampal volumes in persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Since the majority of negative studies have used adolescent samples, it has been suggested that chronicity is a necessary condition for such findings. We have hypothesized that the volumes of hippocampus, amygdale, prefrontal cortex and the intracranial volume are reduced in the patients with PTSD and excessive alcohol intake.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous investigations of auditory P300 event-related potentials have provided electrophysiological evidence for attentional problems in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study sought to evaluate the relationship between P300 deficits and underlying brain morphological abnormalities in never-treated, comorbidity-free patients with PTSD following the Tokyo subway sarin attack. Out of 47 victims recruited, 8 victims with PTSD and 13 victims without PTSD were identified. Correlational analyses were performed between auditory P300 amplitude at Pz electrode site elicited in an oddball task and anterior cingulate gray matter volume that was shown to be reduced in our previous study using voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance imaging. Victims with PTSD showed significantly lower amplitudes of P300 compared with victims without PTSD, and the lower P300 amplitudes at Pz were significantly associated with higher avoidance/numbing scores in the PTSD group. Furthermore, in the PTSD group only, the P300 amplitudes showed a trend toward significant positive correlation with voxel densities of the anterior cingulate cortex gray matter. These results provide the first evidence that electrophysiological deficits of controlled attention observed in patients with PTSD may be linked to underlying brain morphological abnormalities.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects a large portion of combat deployed Veterans. Moreover, many individuals also suffer from comorbid late life depression (geriatric depression; GD). While a great deal of research has begun to characterize the morphometric features of PTSD and depression individually, few studies have investigated the interacting effect of these two disorders, specifically in a Veteran population. The current study used cortical and subcortical surface-based morphometry (SBM) in combination with psychological assessments of PTSD and GD symptom severity to examine morphometric alterations in Vietnam War Veterans. Our results indicated that increased GD severity, PTSD symptomatology, and their interaction, was related to decreased grey matter volume (GMV) in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Furthermore, increased symptomatology in the PTSD subscales of reexperiencing and hyperarousal were additionally found to be related to decreased GMV in this same dmPFC region. Subcortically, the interacting effect between PTSD and GD was also significantly related to regional shape variation in the left amygdala. These results suggest that morphometry of cortical (dmPFC) and non-neocortical regions (amygdala) putatively underlying emotional reactivity and the emotional components of memory is altered in PTSD and GD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Investigations on hippocampal and amygdalar volume have revealed inconsistent results in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Little is known about the structural covariance alterations between the hippocampus and amygdala in PTSD. In this study, we evaluated the alteration in the hippocampal and amygdalar volume and their structural covariance in the coal mine gas explosion related PTSD. High resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on coal mine gas explosion related PTSD male patients (n = 14) and non-traumatized coalminers without PTSD (n = 25). The voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method was used to test the inter-group differences in hippocampal and amygdalar volume as well as the inter-group differences in structural covariance between the ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala. PTSD patients exhibited decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral hippocampi compared to controls (p<0.05, FDR corrected). GMV covariances between the ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala were significantly reduced in PTSD patients compared with controls (p<0.05, FDR corrected). The coalminers with gas explosion related PTSD had decreased hippocampal volume and structural covariance with the ipsilateral amygdala, suggesting that the structural impairment of the hippocampus may implicate in the pathophysiology of PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evidence suggests that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Owing to the region's highly variable patterns, three different studies of PTSD have yielded inconsistent volume reductions. Accordingly, in order to measure the correct borders and volumes, the different patterns of the ACC must be considered separately. We examined 15 victims with chronic symptoms of PTSD, all traumatized at the same accident in 1988, comparing them to 15 matched control subjects. After categorizing the ACC according to single, single segmented, double or double segmented cingulate sulcus (CS), we measured the area with a semi-automated procedure using Brain2 software. Fifty-three percent of our PTSD subjects had single segmented CS compared to 23% in control subjects and 25% in the literature. Furthermore, the four patterns showed differences in mean volume over all subjects of up to 13%. We detected no differences in absolute ACC volumes when differentiating between the patterns or in correlation with brain volumes or clinical parameters. This is the first study to differentiate ACC structure into different patterns in PTSD. We found that one pattern was overrepresented which, in turn, could signal vulnerability to develop PTSD. Because of the remarkable volume differences between patterns, future studies should categorize this highly variable region into different patterns for volumetric measurements. However, future investigations in larger samples should confirm our findings and assess to which extend alterations of ACC patterns may influence the incidence of PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is known to persist, eliciting early medical co-morbidity, and accelerated aging. Although PTSD diagnosis has been found to be associated with smaller volume in multiple brain regions, posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and their associations with brain morphometry are rarely assessed over long periods of time. We predicted that persistent PTS symptoms across ~24 years would be inversely associated with hippocampal, amygdala, anterior cingulate volumes, and hippocampal occupancy (HOC = hippocampal volume/[hippocampal volume + inferior lateral ventricle volume]) in late middle age. Exploratory analyses examined prefrontal regions. We assessed PTS symptoms in 247 men at average ages 38 (time 1) and 62 (time 2). All were trauma-exposed prior to time 1. Brain volumes were assessed at time 2 using 3 T structural magnetic resonance imaging. Symptoms were correlated over time (r = 0.46 p < .0001). Higher PTS symptoms averaged over time and symptoms at time 1 were both associated with lower hippocampal, amygdala, rostral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) volumes, and a lower HOC ratio at time 2. Increased PTS symptomatology from time 1 to time 2 was associated with smaller hippocampal volume. Results for hippocampal, rostral MFG and medial OFC remained significant after omitting individuals above the threshold for PTSD diagnosis. Even at sub-diagnostic threshold levels, PTS symptoms were present decades after trauma exposure in parallel with highly correlated structural deficits in brain regions regulating stress responsivity and adaptation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Numerous imaging studies have reported smaller hippocampal volumes in patients with PTSD. To investigate whether decreased hippocampal volume is associated with PTSD chronicity, independent of age, we used hierarchical linear regression to examine the relationship between PTSD duration (estimated from the amount of time that had elapsed since the traumatic event; mean=17 years; range=6-36 years) and hippocampal volume, adjusting for age and other factors. Freesurfer version 4.5 was used to quantify the volumes of the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus, which served as a "control" region, from the 1.5T Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of 55 combat veterans (mean age 45±9 years) with chronic and current PTSD. PTSD duration was significantly associated with right hippocampal volume (β=-0.34, t=-2.40, P=0.02) after accounting for intracranial volume, age, gender (entered in the first step) and comorbidities (e.g., early life trauma, current major depression, history of substance abuse/dependence, psychotropic medication use, entered in the second step). This finding provides support for the potential neurotoxic effects of PTSD on hippocampal volume.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chronic stress and related physiological responses are known to have deleterious effects on neural integrity. Combat exposure is a notoriously pathogenic stressor and with over 2 million U.S. troops deployed to active combat zones since 2001, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of its potential neural impact. Previous evidence suggests structural alterations in PTSD and more recent studies have explored cortical thinning specifically. This preliminary study investigates the impact of combat exposure on cortical thickness, controlling for history of early life stress and age.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phenytoin (Dilantin) is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy. It is believed to act by modulation of glutamatergic transmission. Because the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hypothesized to involve alterations in glutamatergic transmission with subsequention neurotoxicity, we assessed the effects of phenytoin on cognition and brain structure in PTSD patients. Phenytoin was administered in an open label fashion for 3 months to nine adult patients with PTSD related to a variety of traumas, including early abuse, combat and car accidents. Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging for measurement of whole brain and hippocampal volume, and neuropsychological testing of memory and cognition, before and after treatment. Phenytoin treatment resulted in a significant 6% increase in right brain volume (p < 0.05). Increased hippocampal volume was correlated with reductions in symptom severity as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and improvements in executive function as measured by the Trails test. However, treatment associated improvements in memory and cognition did not achieve statistical significance. These findings suggest that phenytoin treatment may be associated with changes in brain structure in patients with PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recovery of stress-induced structural alterations in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine whether symptoms improvement is associated with grey matter (GM) density changes of brain structures involved in PTSD. Two groups of PTSD patients were involved in this study. The first group was treated with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and recovered from their symptoms (recovery group) (n = 11); Patients were scanned prior to therapy (T1), one week (T2) and five months after the end of therapy (T3). The second group included patients which followed a supportive therapy and remained symptomatic (wait-list group) (n = 7). They were scanned at three time-steps mimicking the same inter-scan intervals. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to characterize GM density evolution. GM density values showed a significant group-by-time interaction effect between T1 and T3 in prefrontal cortex areas. These interaction effects were driven by a GM density increase in the recovery group with respect to the wait-list group. Symptoms removal goes hand-in-hand with GM density enhancement of structures involved in emotional regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by distressing trauma-related memories. According to the dual representation theory, intrusive memories arise from strengthened egocentric encoding and a poor contextual encoding, with spatial context requiring allocentric processing. Contextualization of mental imagery is proposed to be formed hierarchically through the ventral visual stream (VVS) to the hippocampal formation. Here, we tested this notion by investigating whether neuronal aberrations in structures of the VVS or in the hippocampus, as well as allocentric memory performance are associated with intrusive memory severity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the current study, we aim to investigate whether post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with structural alterations in specific subfields of hippocampus comparing with trauma-exposed control (TC) in a relatively large sample. We included 67 PTSD patients who were diagnosed under Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) (DSM-Ⅳ) criteria and 78 age- and sex-matched non-PTSD adult survivors who experienced similar stressors. High resolution T1 weighted images were obtained via a GE 3.0 T scanner. The structural data was automatically segmented using FreeSurfer software, and volume of whole hippocampus and subfield including CA1, CA2-3, CA4-DG, fimbria, presubiculum, subiculum and fissure were extracted. Volume differences between the two groups were statistically compared with age, years of education, duration from the events and intracranial volume (ICV) as covariates. Hemisphere, sex and diagnosis were entered as fixed factors. Relationship between morphometric measurements with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score and illness duration were performed using Pearson's correlation with SPSS.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prefrontal subregions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC, and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), are differentially implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), though few existing studies have examined subregional differences in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). We hypothesized that PTSD would involve weaker positive rsFC between ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and other default mode network regions and increased negative rsFC between DLPFC and posterior default mode network regions. Additionally, we hypothesized that prefrontal regions exhibiting group differences in rsFC would be characterized by alterations in cortical thickness.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neuroanatomical evidence on the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative disorders is still lacking. We acquired brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 17 patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID) and co-morbid PTSD (DID-PTSD) and 16 patients with PTSD but without DID (PTSD-only), and 32 healthy controls (HC), and compared their whole-brain cortical and subcortical gray matter (GM) morphological measurements. Associations between GM measurements and severity of dissociative and depersonalization/derealization symptoms or lifetime traumatizing events were evaluated in the patient groups. DID-PTSD and PTSD-only patients, compared with HC, had similarly smaller cortical GM volumes of the whole brain and of frontal, temporal and insular cortices. DID-PTSD patients additionally showed smaller hippocampal and larger pallidum volumes relative to HC, and larger putamen and pallidum volumes relative to PTSD-only. Severity of lifetime traumatizing events and volume of the hippocampus were negatively correlated. Severity of dissociative and depersonalization/derealization symptoms correlated positively with volume of the putamen and pallidum, and negatively with volume of the inferior parietal cortex. Shared abnormal brain structures in DID-PTSD and PTSD-only, small hippocampal volume in DID-PTSD, more severe lifetime traumatizing events in DID-PTSD compared with PTSD-only, and negative correlations between lifetime traumatizing events and hippocampal volume suggest a trauma-related etiology for DID. Our results provide neurobiological evidence for the side-by-side nosological classification of PTSD and DID in the DSM-5.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been frequently associated with volumetric reductions of grey matter structures (e.g. hippocampus and anterior cingulate), but these results remain controversial, especially in female non-combat-related samples. The present study aimed at exploring whole-brain structures in women with sexual abuse-related PTSD on the basis of cortical and subcortical structure comparisons to a matched pair sample that was well-controlled. Seventeen young women who had experienced sexual abuse and who had a diagnosis of chronic PTSD based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV and 17 healthy controls individually matched for age and years of education were consecutively recruited. Both groups underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and psychiatric assessment of the main disorders according to Axis I of DSM-IV. The resulting scans were analyzed using automated cortical and subcortical volumetric quantifications. Compared with controls, PTSD subjects displayed normal global and regional brain volumes and cortical thicknesses. Our results indicate preserved subcortical volumes and cortical thickness in a sample of female survivors of sexual abuse with PTSD. The authors discuss potential differences between neural mechanisms of sexual abuse-related PTSD and war-related PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by atrophy within the prefrontal-limbic network. Graph analysis was used to investigate to what degree atrophy in PTSD is associated with impaired structural connectivity within prefrontal limbic network (restricted) and how this affects the integration of the prefrontal limbic network with the rest of the brain (whole-brain). 85 male veterans (45 PTSD neg, 40 PTSD pos) underwent volumetric MRI on a 3T MR. Subfield volumes were obtained using a manual labeling scheme and cortical thickness measurements and subcortical volumes from FreeSurfer. Regression analysis was used to identify regions with volume loss. Graph analytical Toolbox (GAT) was used for graph-analysis. PTSD pos had a thinner rostral anterior cingulate and insular cortex but no hippocampal volume loss. PTSD was characterized by decreased nodal degree (orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate) and clustering coefficients (thalamus) but increased nodal betweenness (insula, orbitofrontal) and a reduced small world index in the whole brain analysis and by orbitofrontal and insular nodes with increased nodal degree, clustering coefficient and nodal betweenness in the restricted analysis. PTSD associated atrophy in the prefrontal-limbic network results in an increased structural connectivity within that network that negatively affected its integration with the rest of the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of this study was to determine whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated with an increase in time-related decline in macrostructural brain volume and whether these changes were associated with accelerated cognitive decline. To quantify brain structure, three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans were performed at baseline and again after a minimum of 24months in 25 patients with PTSD (PTSD+) and 22 controls (PTSD-). Longitudinal changes in brain volume were measured using deformation morphometry. For the group as a whole, PTSD+ patients did not show significant ongoing brain atrophy compared to PTSD-. PTSD+ patients were then subgrouped into those with decreasing or increasing symptoms. We found little evidence for brain markers of accelerated atrophy in PTSD+ veterans whose symptoms improved over time, with only a small left parietal region showing greater ongoing tissue loss than PTSD-. PTSD patients whose symptoms increased over time showed accelerated atrophy throughout the brain, particularly brainstem and frontal and temporal lobes. Lastly, for the sample as a whole, greater rates of brain atrophy were associated with greater rates of decline in verbal memory and delayed facial recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two decades of human neuroimaging research have associated volume reductions in the hippocampus with posttraumatic stress disorder. However, little is known about the distribution of volume loss across hippocampal subfields. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have made it possible to accurately delineate 10 gray matter hippocampal subfields. Here, we apply a volumetric analysis of hippocampal subfields to data from a group of combat-exposed Veterans.</p>

<h3>Abstract Content</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Different subterritories of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and adjacent ventromedial frontal cortex have been shown to serve distinct functions. This scheme has influenced contemporary pathophysiologic models of psychiatric disorders. Prevailing neurocircuitry models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate dysfunction within pregenual ACC and subcallosal cortex (SC), as well as amygdala and hippocampus. In the current study, cortical parcellation of magnetic resonance imaging data was performed to test for volumetric differences in pregenual ACC and SC, between women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women without PTSD. The PTSD group exhibited selectively decreased pregenual ACC and SC volumes. These results are consistent with contemporary schemes regarding functional and structural dissection of frontal cortex, and suggest specific regional cortical pathology in PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In depression, brain and behavioral correlates of decision-making differ between individuals with and without suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Though promising, it remains unknown if these potential biomarkers of suicidality will generalize to other high-risk clinical populations. To preliminarily assess whether brain structure or function tracked suicidality in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we measured resting-state functional connectivity and cortical thickness in two functional networks involved in decision-making, a ventral fronto-striatal reward network and a lateral frontal cognitive control network. Neuroimaging data and self-reported suicidality ratings, and suicide-related hospitalization data were obtained from 50 outpatients with PTSD and also from 15 healthy controls, and all were subjected to seed-based resting-state functional connectivity and cortical thickness analyses using </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be seen to represent a failure to extinguish learned fear, significant aspects of the pathophysiology relevant to this hypothesis remain unknown. Both the amygdala and hippocampus are necessary for fear extinction occur, and thus both regions may be abnormal in PTSD. Twenty-five people who experienced the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995, nine who later developed PTSD and 16 who did not, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with manual tracing to determine bilateral amygdala and hippocampus volumes. At the time of scanning, one had PTSD and eight had a history of PTSD. Results indicated that the group with a history of PTSD had significantly smaller mean bilateral amygdala volume than did the group that did not develop PTSD. Furthermore, left amygdala volume showed a significant negative correlation with severity of PTSD symptomatology as well as reduced gray matter density in the left anterior cingulate cortex. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of an association between PTSD and amygdala volume. Furthermore the apparent interplay between amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex represents support at the level of gross brain morphology for the theory of PTSD as a failure of fear extinction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in military personnel is increasing dramatically following the OEF/OIF conflicts and is associated with alterations to brain structure. The present study examined the relationship between PTSD and cortical thickness, and its possible modification by mTBI, in a 104-subject OEF/OIF veteran cohort ranging in age from 20 to 62 years. For each participant, two T1-weighted scans were averaged to create high-resolution images for calculation of regional cortical thickness. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and scores were derived based on the previous month's symptoms ("current") and a Cumulative Lifetime Burden of PTSD (CLB-P) reflecting the integral of CAPS scores across the lifetime. Mild TBI was diagnosed using the Boston Assessment of TBI-Lifetime (BAT-L). Results demonstrated a clear negative relationship between current PTSD severity and thickness in both postcentral gyri and middle temporal gyri. This relationship was stronger and more extensive when considering lifetime burden (CLB-P), demonstrating the importance of looking at trauma in the context of an individual's lifetime, rather than only at their current symptoms. Finally, interactions with current PTSD only and comorbid current PTSD and mTBI were found in several regions, implying an additive effect of lifetime PTSD and mTBI on cortical thickness.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oxidative stress has been implicated in many common age-related diseases and is hypothesized to play a role in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related neurodegeneration (Miller and Sadeh, 2014). This study examined the influence of the oxidative stress-related genes ALOX 12 and ALOX 15 on the association between PTSD and cortical thickness. Factor analyses were used to identify and compare alternative models of the structure of cortical thickness in a sample of 218 veterans. The best-fitting model was then used for a genetic association analysis in White non-Hispanic participants (n=146) that examined relationships between 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the two genes, 8 cortical thickness factors, and each SNP×PTSD interaction. Results identified a novel ALOX12 locus (indicated by two SNPs in perfect linkage disequilibrium: rs1042357 and rs10852889) that moderated the association between PTSD and reduced thickness of the right prefrontal cortex. A whole-cortex vertex-wise analysis showed this effect to be localized to clusters spanning the rostral middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. These findings illustrate a novel factor-analytic approach to neuroimaging-genetic analyses and provide new evidence for the possible involvement of oxidative stress in PTSD-related neurodegeneration.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Auditory sensory gating deficits have been reported in subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the hemispheric and neuronal origins of this deficit are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate auditory sensory gating of the 50-ms response (M50) in patients diagnosed with PTSD by utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG); (2) explore the relationship between M50 sensory gating and cortical thickness of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and (3) examine the association between PTSD symptomatology and bilateral sensory gating. Seven participants with combat-related PTSD and eleven controls underwent the paired-click sensory gating paradigm. MEG localized M50 neuronal generators to the STG in both groups. The PTSD group displayed impaired M50 gating in the right hemisphere. Thinner right STG cortical thickness was associated with worse right sensory gating in the PTSD group. The right S1 M50 source strength and gating ratio were correlated with PTSD symptomatology. These findings suggest that the structural integrity of right hemisphere STG cortices play an important role in auditory sensory gating deficits in PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Depending on the traumatic event, a significant fraction of trauma survivors subsequently develop PTSD. The additional variability in PTSD risk is expected to arise from genetic susceptibility. Unfortunately, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have failed to identify a consistent genetic marker for PTSD. The heritability of intermediate phenotypes such as regional brain volumes is often 80% or higher. We conducted a GWAS of subcortical brain volumes in a sample of recent military veteran trauma survivors (n = 157), grouped into PTSD (n = 66) and non-PTSD controls (n = 91). Covariates included PTSD diagnosis, sex, intracranial volume, ancestry, childhood trauma, SNP×PTSD diagnosis, and SNP×childhood trauma.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Severe and chronic stress affects the hippocampus, especially during development. However, studies concerning structural alterations of the hippocampus yielded a rather inconsistent picture. Moreover, further anxiety-relevant brain regions, such as the insula, might be implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We combined magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric and spectroscopic analyses of hippocampus and insula in highly traumatized refugees without a history of alcohol/substance abuse or other comorbid diseases. No PTSD-related difference was apparent in the volumes or neurometabolite levels of bilateral hippocampus or insula. However, an association between left hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and adverse childhood experiences indicated a potential detrimental effect of the early environment on hippocampal integrity. Our results add to increasing evidence that PTSD-related, morphological alterations in the hippocampus are a consequence of early adversity or may result from other factors, such as extensive use of alcohol.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Defining exact position of weak anatomic function which is find in a base of neurological and psychiatric disorder is just became the subject of intensive research interest. For this purposes it is important to implement structural and functional MRI techniques, also for further lightening and seeing subject of this work, more concretely connected to PTSD. Therefore, exactly MRI gives most sensitive volumetric measuring of hippocampal formation and amygdaloidal complex. The goal of this work was to research asymmetry of hippocampal formation and amygdaloidal complex to the PTSD patients. Results showed that at the axial slice length of hippocampal formation on the left and right side of all patients are significantly asymmetric. At the sagittal slice from the left side of hippocampal formation is in many cases longer than right about 50 %. At the coronal slice, there are no significant differences toward patient proportion according to symm./asymm. of the hippocampal formation width at the right and left side. Difference in volume average of hippocampal formation between right and left side for axial and coronal slice is not statistically significant, but it is significant for sagittal slice. In about amygdaloidal complex patients with PTSD toward symm./asymm. Amygdaloidal complex at the right and left side of axial and sagittal slice in all three measurement shows asymmetry, what is especially shown at sagittal slice. Difference in average length of amygdaloidal complex at the right and left side is not statistically significant for no one slice. Therefore, results of a new research that are used MRI, showed smaller hippocampal level at PTSD (researched by Van der Kolka 1996, Pitman 1996, Bremner et al., 1995.). Application of MRI technique in research of asymmetry of hippocampal formation and amygdaloidal complex, which we used in our research, we recommend as a template for future researches in a sense of lightening anatomic function that is a base of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alexithymia, or "no words for feelings", is highly prevalent in samples with childhood maltreatment and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been identified as a key region involved in alexithymia, early life trauma, and PTSD. Functional alterations in the dACC also have been associated with alexithymia in PTSD. This study examined whether dACC morphology is a neural correlate of alexithymia in child maltreatment-related PTSD. Sixteen adults with PTSD and a history of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exposure to domestic violence, and 24 healthy controls (HC) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness of the dACC was measured using FreeSurfer, and values were correlated with TAS-20 scores, controlling for sex and age, in both groups. Average TAS-20 score was significantly higher in the PTSD than the HC group. TAS-20 scores were significantly positively associated with dACC thickness only in the PTSD group. This association was strongest in the left hemisphere and for TAS-20 subscales that assess difficulty identifying and describing feelings. We found that increasing dACC gray matter thickness is a neural correlate of greater alexithymia in the context of PTSD with childhood maltreatment. While findings are correlational, they motivate further inquiry into the relationships between childhood adversity, emotional awareness and expression, and dACC morphologic development in trauma-related psychopathology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigated the extent of cortical thinning in U.S. Veterans exposed to combat who varied in the severity of their posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. In addition, we explored the neural correlates of PTSD symptom dimensions and the interactive effects of combat exposure and PTSD upon cortical thickness. Sixty-nine combat exposed Veterans completed high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to estimate cortical thickness. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Combat Exposure Scale (CES) assessments were completed to measure current PTSD and historical combat severity, respectively. PTSD symptom dimensions (numbing, avoidance, reexperiencing, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal) were studied. Vertex-wise whole cerebrum analyses were conducted. We found widespread negative correlations between CAPS severity and cortical thickness, particularly within the prefrontal cortex. This prefrontal correlation remained significant after controlling for depression severity, medication status, and other potential confounds. PTSD dimensions, except anxious arousal, negatively correlated with cortical thickness in various unique brain regions. CES negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the left lateral prefrontal, regardless of PTSD diagnosis. A significant interaction between CES and PTSD diagnosis was found, such that CES negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the non-PTSD, but not in the PTSD, participants. The results underscore the severity of cortical thinning in U.S. Veterans suffering from high level of PTSD symptoms, as well as in Veterans with no PTSD diagnosis but severe combat exposure. The latter finding raises considerable concerns about a concealed injury potentially related to combat exposure in the post-9/11 era.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although smaller hippocampi and amygdalae were found in cancer survivors with intrusions, associations between cancer-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and these volumes are unknown. The authors performed MRI volumetric analyses of these regions in 15 cancer survivors with PTSD, 15 cancer survivors without PTSD, and 15 healthy comparison subjects. The authors also examined the correlation between PTSD symptom scores of the Impact of Event Scale and these volumes in the PTSD group. These volumes were not significantly different among the groups, but the intrusion score was inversely associated with the hippocampal volume. Results suggest intrusions, not PTSD diagnosis, might be associated with hippocampal volume.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite an increasing focus on transdiagnostic approaches to mental health, it remains unclear whether different diagnostic categories share a common neuronatomical basis. The current investigation sought to investigate whether a transdiagnostic set of structural alterations characterized schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and determine whether any such alterations reflected markers of psychiatric illness or pre-existing familial vulnerability. A total of 404 patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were recruited (psychosis, n = 129; unipolar depression, n = 92; post-traumatic stress disorder, n = 91; obsessive-compulsive disorder, n = 92) alongside n = 201 healthy controls and n = 20 unaffected first-degree relatives. We collected structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from each participant, and tested for transdiagnostic alterations using Voxel-based morphometry. Inferences were made at p < 0.05 after family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons. The four psychiatric groups relative to healthy controls were all characterized by significantly greater gray matter volume in the putamen (right: z-score: 5.97, p-value < 0.001; left: z-score: 4.97, p-value = 0.001); the volume of this region was positively correlated with severity of symptoms across groups (r = 0.313; p < 0.001). Putamen enlargement was also evident in unaffected relatives compared to healthy controls (right: z-score: 8.13, p-value < 0.001; left: z-score: 9.38, p-value < 0.001). Taken collectively, these findings indicate that increased putamen volume may reflect a transdiagnostic marker of familial vulnerability to psychopathology. This is consistent with emerging conceptualizations of psychiatric illness, in which each disorder is understood as a combination of diagnosis-specific features and a transdiagnostic factor reflecting general psychopathology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Studies have shown that early life trauma may influence neural development and increase the risk of developing psychological disorders in adulthood. We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the impact of early life trauma on the relationship between current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and cortical thickness/subcortical volumes in a sample of deployed personnel from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. A group of 108 service members enrolled in the Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) were divided into those with interpersonal early life trauma (EL-Trauma+) and Control (without interpersonal early life trauma) groups based on the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were analyzed using the FreeSurfer image analysis package. Thickness of the paracentral and posterior cingulate regions was positively associated with PTSD severity in the EL-Trauma+ group and negatively in the Control group. In the EL-Trauma+ group, both the right amygdala and the left hippocampus were positively associated with PTSD severity. This study illustrates a possible influence of early life trauma on the vulnerability of specific brain regions to stress. Changes in neural morphometry may provide information about the emergence and maintenance of symptoms in individuals with PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The concept of acute stress disorder (ASD) was introduced as a diagnostic entity to improve the identification of traumatized people who are likely to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neuroanatomical models suggest that changes in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus play a role in the development of PTSD. Using voxel-based morphometry, this study aimed to investigate the predictive power of gray matter volume (GMV) alterations for developing PTSD. The GMVs of ASD patients (n = 21) were compared to those of PTSD patients (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 18) in whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses. The GMV alterations seen in ASD patients shortly after the traumatic event (T1) were also correlated with PTSD symptom severity and symptom clusters 4 weeks later (T2). Compared with healthy controls, the ASD patients had significantly reduced GMV in the left visual cortex shortly after the traumatic event (T1) and in the left occipital and prefrontal regions 4 weeks later (T2); no significant differences in GMV were seen between the ASD and PTSD patients. Furthermore, a significant negative association was found between the GMV reduction in the left lateral temporal regions seen after the traumatic event (T1) and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms 4 weeks later (T2). Neither amygdala nor hippocampus alterations were predictive for the development of PTSD. These data suggest that gray matter deficiencies in the left hemispheric occipital and temporal regions in ASD patients may predict a liability for developing PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is vulnerable to the simulation or exaggeration of symptoms as it depends on the individual's self-report of symptoms. The use of symptom validity tests is recommended to detect malingering in PTSD. However, in neuroimaging research, PTSD diagnosis is often taken at face validity. To date, no neuroimaging study has compared credible PTSD patients with those identified as malingering, and the potential impacts of including malingerers along with credible patients on results is unclear. We classified male patients with combat-related PTSD as either credible (n = 37) or malingerers (n = 9) based on the Morel Emotional Numbing Test and compared structural neuroimaging and psychological questionnaire data. Patients identified as malingerers had larger gray matter volumes in the hippocampus, right inferior frontal gyrus and thalamus, and reported higher PTSD symptoms than credible PTSD patients. This is the first structural neuroimaging study to compare credible PTSD patients and malingerers. We find evidence of structural differences between these groups, in regions implicated in PTSD, inhibition and deception. These results emphasize the need for the inclusion of SVTs in neuroimaging studies of PTSD to ensure future findings are not confounded by an unknown mix of valid PTSD patients and malingerers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition associated with a range of brain imaging abnormalities. Early life stress (ELS) contributes to this heterogeneity, but we do not know how a history of ELS influences traditionally defined brain signatures of PTSD. Here, we used a novel machine learning method - evolving partitions to improve classification (EPIC) - to identify shared and unique structural neuroimaging markers of ELS and PTSD in 97 combat-exposed military veterans.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among other postassault characteristics, self-blame attributions were suggested to play an important role in sexually assaulted individuals' coping and were consistently associated with PTSD in this population. The present study aimed to elucidate the neural underpinnings that may associate self-blame and PTSD in women who experienced sexual assault at adulthood, using structural and resting-state functional MRI. Thirty-eight sexually assaulted women and 24 non-exposed matched controls were studied (mean age: 25 years). Among the sexually assaulted participants, assault-related self-blame was negatively correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) bilaterally in the lingual gyrus and adjacent intracalcarine cortex. GMV in this cluster was also predicted by intrusion symptoms and negative social reactions. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of this cluster with the left anterior temporal fusiform cortex significantly differed between PTSD and non-PTSD sexually assaulted participants, and was inversely correlated with intrusion symptoms and with peritraumatic dissociation. Finally, lingual cluster's GMV and rs-FC with the anterior fusiform mediated the association between self-blame and intrusion symptoms across sexually assaulted participants. These findings link assault-related self-blame, disrupted postassault recovery and the neural circuitry involved in the processing of traumatic memories.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are two of the most common consequences of combat deployment. Estimates of comorbidity of PTSD and mTBI are as high as 42% in combat exposed Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans. Combat deployed Veterans with PTSD and/or mTBI exhibit deficits in classic executive function (EF) tasks. Similarly, the extant neuroimaging literature consistently indicates abnormalities of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala/hippocampal complex in these individuals. While studies examining deficits in classical EF constructs and aberrant neural circuitry have been widely replicated, it is surprising that little research examining reward processing and decision-making has been conducted in these individuals, specifically, because the vmPFC has long been implicated in underlying such processes. Therefore, the current study employed the modified Iowa Gambling Task (mIGT) and structural neuroimaging to assess whether behavioral measures related to reward processing and decision-making were compromised and related to cortical morphometric features of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with PTSD, mTBI, or co-occurring PTSD/mTBI. Results indicated that gray matter morphometry in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) predicted performance on the mIGT among all three groups and was significantly reduced, as compared to the control group.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many research papers claim that patients with specific psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, alcohol use disorder, and others) have smaller hippocampi, but most of those reports compared patients to healthy controls. We hypothesized that if psychiatrically matched controls (psychiatric control, matched for demographics and psychiatric comorbidities) were used, much of the biomarker literature in psychiatric research would not replicate. We used hippocampus and amygdala volume only as examples, as these are very commonly replicated results in psychiatry biomarker research. We propose that psychiatry biomarker research could benefit from using psychiatric controls, as the use of healthy controls results in data that are not disorder-specific.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous studies suggest that amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex (PFC) disintegrity play a crucial role in the failure to adequately regulate emotions in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). However, prior results are confounded by the high rate of comorbidity with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which itself has been associated with changes in frontolimbic circuitry. We thus scrutinized the link between PFC, amygdala, insula, and the ability to regulate emotions, contrasting 17 women with BPD without comorbid PTSD to 27 non-clinical control women and in addition to those with BPD and PTSD (n = 14). BPD women without PTSD, but not those with comorbid PTSD, had increased cortical thickness in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) in comparison to control women. Furthermore, cortical thickness in the DLPFC of BPD women without PTSD positively correlated with emotion regulation scores and furthermore was positively associated with amygdala volume, as well as cortical thickness of the insula. Our findings highlight the importance of disentangling the impact of BPD and PTSD on the brain and suggest possible compensatory mechanisms for the impaired emotion regulation in BPD women without PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traumatic experiences and subsequent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to affect brain structure and function. Although police officers are routinely exposed to traumatic events, the neurobehavioral effects of trauma in this population have rarely been studied. In this study, police officers with exposure to trauma-related stressors underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They also provided valence and arousal ratings of neutral and negative (trauma-related) picture stimuli. Relationships were examined among PTSD symptom scores (avoidance, reexperiencing, and hyperarousal), picture ratings, structural MRI measures, and number of trauma exposures. We hypothesized that greater PTSD symptomatology would be related to higher valence and arousal ratings of trauma-related stimuli and to decreased volume of limbic and Basal ganglia structures. Results revealed that officers with higher reexperiencing scores tended to have higher arousal ratings of negative pictures and reduced amygdala, thalamus, and globus pallidus volumes. There was a trend toward higher reexperiencing and reduced hippocampal volume. The frequency of traumatic exposures was also related to MRI measures of atrophy and to increased PTSD symptomatology. These findings suggest that chronic reexperiencing of traumatic events may result in volumetric reductions in brain structures associated with autonomic arousal and the acquisition of conditioned fear.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interaction between childhood trauma and genetic factors influences the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined the interaction effect of childhood trauma and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism on PTSD symptoms and brain cortical thickness. A total of 216 participants (133 healthy volunteers and 83 PTSD patients) were recruited. T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging, BDNF rs6265 genotyping through blood sampling, and clinical assessments including the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) and posttraumatic stress disorder Checklist (PCL) were performed. A moderated regression analysis, two-way multivariate analysis of covariance, and correlation analysis were conducted. An interaction between the CTQ and the BDNF polymorphism significantly influenced PTSD symptom severity. In fact, people with rs6265 Val/Val genotype and higher CTQ scores showed higher PCL scores. Additionally, this interaction was significant on both left fusiform and transverse temporal gyri thickness. Furthermore, the thickness of both brain regions was significantly correlated with psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, rumination, and cognitive emotion regulation methods; yet this was mainly observed in people with the Val/Val genotype. The interaction between childhood trauma and BDNF polymorphism significantly influences both PTSD symptoms and cortical thickness and the Val/Val genotype may increase the risk in Korean population.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The core neuropsychological processes underlying post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yet to be elucidated, and the association between anatomical and functional deficits in PTSD remains largely unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the alterations in cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in PTSD patients resulting from motor vehicle accidents (MVCs), and to explore the association of cortical thickness and ALFF with the severity of PTSD symptoms. A total of 20 PTSD patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited and examined by high-resolution structural MRI combined with resting-state fMRI. The results showed significant decrease in cortical thickness in the left BA10, BA32 and BA45 and the right superior temporal gyrus in PTSD patients. The ALFF value in PTSD patients increased significantly in the left BA10 and BA32 and the right cerebellum. Linear regression revealed that decreased cortical thickness and increased ALFF in the BA10 were associated with the increased PTSD scores. These findings suggest that the structural integrity and resting-state function in the BA10 play an important role in the pathogenesis of PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is an objective whole-brain technique for characterizing regional cerebral volume and tissue concentration differences in structural magnetic resonance images. In the current study, we used VBM to examine possible cerebral gray matter abnormalities in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to fire. The subjects included 12 victims of a fire disaster with PTSD and 12 matched victims of the same fire without PTSD. Magnetic resonance images were obtained on a 1.5-Tesla General Electric scanner at Central South University, and an entire brain volume of 248 contiguous slices was obtained for each subject. Then, gray matter density in patients with PTSD and control groups was compared by using a VBM approach in SPM2. Group analysis was thresholded at P<0.001, uncorrected, at the voxel level. The following three regions of reduced gray matter volume were found in patients with PTSD compared with controls: left hippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral insular cortex. It was concluded that there are structural abnormalities of the hippocampus, the ACC and the insular cortex in patients with PTSD due to fire.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with functional abnormalities within a neurocircuitry that includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. Evidence of structural abnormalities within these regions, and their association with PTSD severity and symptom burden is, however, sparse. The present study evaluated the relation between indices of gray matter volume and PTSD symptom severity using voxel-based morphometry. Fifteen individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for PTSD completed the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Greater PTSD severity and avoidance/numbing were correlated with increased gray matter volume of the right amygdala-hippocampal complex. Greater hyper-arousal was associated with reduced gray matter volume in the left superior medial frontal gyrus. Findings are consistent with current neurocircuitry models of PTSD, which posit that the disorder is associated with structural and functional variance within this distributed network.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Military service members frequently sustain traumatic brain injuries (TBI) while on active duty, a majority of which are related to explosive blasts and are mild in severity. Studies evaluating the cortical gray matter in persons with injuries of this nature remain scarce. The purpose of this study was to assess cortical thickness in a sample of military veterans with chronic blast-related TBI. Thirty-eight veterans with mild TBI and 17 veterans with moderate TBI were compared with 58 demographically matched healthy civilians. All veterans with TBI sustained injuries related to a blast and were between 5 and 120 months post-injury (M = 62.08). Measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were administered, along with a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess cognition. The Freesurfer software package was used to calculate cortical thickness of the participants. Results demonstrated significant clusters of cortical thinning in the right hemispheric insula and inferior portions of the temporal and frontal lobe in both mild and moderate TBI participants. The TBI sample from this study demonstrated a high incidence of comorbid PTSD and depression symptoms, which is consistent with the previous literature. Cortical thickness values correlated with measures of PTSD, depression, and post-concussive symptoms. This study provides evidence of cortical thinning in the context of chronic blast-related mild and moderate TBI in military veterans who have comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Our findings provide important insight into the natural progression of long-term cortical change in this population and may have implications for future clinical evaluation and treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a significant health concern. The majority who sustain mTBI recover, although ~20 % continue to experience symptoms that can interfere with quality of life. Accordingly, there is a critical need to improve diagnosis, prognostic accuracy, and monitoring (recovery trajectory over time) of mTBI. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully utilized to examine TBI. One promising improvement over standard volumetric approaches is to analyze high-dimensional shape characteristics of brain structures. In this study, subcortical shape and volume in 76 Service Members with mTBI was compared to 59 Service Members with orthopedic injury (OI) and 17 with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) only. FreeSurfer was used to quantify structures from T1-weighted 3 T MRI data. Radial distance (RD) and Jacobian determinant (JD) were defined vertex-wise on parametric mesh-representations of subcortical structures. Linear regression was used to model associations between morphometry (volume and shape), TBI status, and time since injury (TSI) correcting for age, sex, intracranial volume, and level of education. Volumetric data was not significantly different between the groups. JD was significantly increased in the accumbens and caudate and significantly reduced in the thalamus of mTBI participants. Additional significant associations were noted between RD of the amygdala and TSI. Positive trend-level associations between TSI and the amygdala and accumbens were observed, while a negative association was observed for third ventricle. Our findings may aid in the initial diagnosis of mTBI, provide biological targets for functional examination, and elucidate regions that may continue remodeling after injury.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To date, few studies have evaluated the contribution of early life experiences to neurocognitive abnormalities observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Childhood maltreatment is common among individuals with PTSD and is thought to catalyze stress-related biobehavioral changes that might impact both brain structure and function in adulthood. The current study examined differences in brain morphology (brain volume, cortical thickness) and neuropsychological performance in individuals with PTSD characterized by low or high self-reported childhood maltreatment, compared with healthy comparison participants. Data were drawn from the INjury and TRaUmatic STress (INTRuST) Clinical Consortium imaging repository, which contains MRI and self-report data for individuals classified as PTSD positive (with and without a history of mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]), individuals with mTBI only, and healthy comparison participants. The final sample included 36 individuals with PTSD without childhood maltreatment exposure (PTSD, n = 30 with mTBI), 31 individuals with PTSD and childhood maltreatment exposure (PTSD + M, n = 26 with mTBI), and 114 healthy comparison participants without history of childhood maltreatment exposure (HC). The PTSD + M and PTSD groups demonstrated cortical thinning in prefrontal and occipital regions, and poorer verbal memory and processing speed compared to the HC group. PTSD + M participants demonstrated cortical thinning in frontal and cingulate regions, and poorer executive functioning relative to the PTSD and HC groups. Thus, neurocognitive features varied between individuals with PTSD who did versus did not have exposure to childhood maltreatment, highlighting the need to assess developmental history of maltreatment when examining biomarkers in PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to psychological trauma, impacts up to 20 % of soldiers returning from combat-related deployment. Advanced neuroimaging holds diagnostic and prognostic potential for furthering our understanding of its etiology. Previous imaging studies on combat-related PTSD have focused on selected structures, such as the hippocampi and cortex, but none conducted a comprehensive examination of both the cerebrum and cerebellum. The present study provides a complete analysis of cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar anatomy in a single cohort. Forty-seven magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were collected from 24 soldiers with PTSD and 23 Control soldiers. Each image was segmented into 78 cortical brain regions and 81,924 vertices using the corticometric iterative vertex based estimation of thickness algorithm, allowing for both a region-based and a vertex-based cortical analysis, respectively. Subcortical volumetric analyses of the hippocampi, cerebellum, thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate, putamen, and many sub-regions were conducted following their segmentation using Multiple Automatically Generated Templates Brain algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Smaller hippocampal volume has been reported in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder (DID), but the regional specificity of hippocampal volume reductions and the association with severity of dissociative symptoms and/or childhood traumatization are still unclear. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed for 33 outpatients (17 with DID and 16 with PTSD only) and 28 healthy controls (HC), all matched for age, sex, and education. DID patients met criteria for PTSD (PTSD-DID). Hippocampal global and subfield volumes and shape measurements were extracted. We found that global hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in all 33 patients (left: 6.75%; right: 8.33%) compared with HC. PTSD-DID (left: 10.19%; right: 11.37%) and PTSD-only with a history of childhood traumatization (left: 7.11%; right: 7.31%) had significantly smaller global hippocampal volume relative to HC. PTSD-DID had abnormal shape and significantly smaller volume in the CA2-3, CA4-DG and (pre)subiculum compared with HC. In the patient groups, smaller global and subfield hippocampal volumes significantly correlated with higher severity of childhood traumatization and dissociative symptoms. These findings support a childhood trauma-related etiology for abnormal hippocampal morphology in both PTSD and DID and can further the understanding of neurobiological mechanisms involved in these disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A variety of structural abnormalities have been described in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but only a few studies have focused on cortical thickness alterations in recent onset PTSD. In this study, we adopted surface-based morphometry (SBM), which enables an exploration of global structural changes throughout the brain, in order to compare cortical thickness alterations in recent onset PTSD patients, trauma-exposed subjects but without PTSD, and normal controls. Moreover, we used region of interest (ROI) partial correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation among PTSD symptom severity and significant changes of cortical thickness. The widespread cortical thickness reduction relative to the normal controls were found in bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobes, frontal lobes, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and right lateral occipital lobes in trauma survivors, whereas cortical thickness was only increased in left calcarine cortex in PTSD group. The average cortical thickness of hippocampus and cingulate cortex decreased by 10.75% and 9.09% in PTSD, 3.48% and 2.86% in non PTSD. We further demonstrated that the cortical thicknesses of bilateral ACC and PCC, superior frontal lobes, and hippocampus are negatively correlated with CAPS scores in all trauma survivors. Our study results suggest that stress widens cortical thinning regions and causes more serious effect in recent onset PTSD than non PTSD. It also shows that the cortical thinning in recent onset PTSD predicts the symptom severity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Voxel based morphometry (VBM) methods are used to detect the difference in brain structures between the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) sufferers and the normal controls. Standard VBM method can detect the difference of the gray matter or white matter densities while the optimized VBM method can detect the difference of gray matter or white matter volumes in the whole brain. The experiments showed that for the patient group, gray matter density or volumes significantly increased in the right frontal lobe, middle frontal gyrus, vermis, left caudate and parietal lobe, compared with the normal controls. However, in the left frontal lobe and middle frontal gyrus, gray matter density significantly decreased. There is no significant difference in white matter between the two groups. These results are consistent with those of the fMRI, which not only provide the evidence for further study of the pathogeny in PTSD but also validate the efficiency of the VBM methods for detecting the difference in the whole brain structure.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). To better understand their relationship, we examined neuroanatomical structures and neuropsychological performance in a sample of individuals with mTBI, with and without PTSD symptoms. Thirty-nine subjects with mTBI were dichotomized into those with (n = 12) and without (n = 27) significant PTSD symptoms based on scores on the PTSD Checklist. Using a region-of-interest approach, fronto-temporal volumes, fiber bundles obtained by diffusion tensor imaging, and neuropsychological scores were compared between the two groups. After controlling for total intracranial volume and age, subjects with mTBI and PTSD symptoms exhibited volumetric differences in the entorhinal cortex, an area associated with memory networks, relative to mTBI-only patients (F = 4.28; p = 0.046). Additionally, subjects with PTSD symptoms showed reduced white matter integrity in the right cingulum bundle (axial diffusivity, F = 6.04; p = 0.020). Accompanying these structural alterations, mTBI and PTSD subjects also showed impaired performance in encoding (F = 5.98; p = 0.019) and retrieval (F = 7.32; p = 0.010) phases of list learning and in tests of processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Processing Speed Index, F = 12.23; p = 0.001; Trail Making Test A, F = 5.56; p = 0.024). Increased volume and white matter disruptions in these areas, commonly associated with memory functions, may be related to functional disturbances during cognitively demanding tasks. Differences in brain volume and white matter integrity between mTBI subjects and those with mTBI and co-morbid PTSD symptoms point to neuroanatomical differences that may underlie poorer recovery of mTBI subjects who experience PTSD symptoms. These findings support theoretical models of PTSD and its relationship to learning deficits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the anatomical overlap between the brain's fear/threat and olfactory systems, a very limited number of investigations have considered the role of odors and the central olfactory system in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The goal of the present study was to assess structural differences in primary and secondary olfactory cortex between combat veterans with and without PTSD (CV + PTSD, CV-PTSD, respectively). An additional goal was to determine the relationship between gray matter volume (GMV) in olfactory cortex and the distressing properties of burning-related odors. A region of interest voxel-based morphometric (VBM) approach was used to measure GMV in olfactory cortex in a well-characterized group of CV + PTSD (n = 20) and CV-PTSD (n = 25). Prior to the MRI exam, combat-related (i.e., burning rubber) and control odors were systematically sampled and rated according to their potential for eliciting PTSD symptoms. Results showed that CV + PTSD exhibited significantly reduced GMV in anterior piriform (primary olfactory) and orbitofrontal (secondary olfactory) cortices compared to CV-PTSD (both p < .01). For the entire group, GMV in bilateral anterior piriform cortex was inversely related to burning rubber odor-elicited memories of trauma (p < .05). GMV in orbitofrontal cortex was inversely related to both clinical and laboratory measures of PTSD symptoms (all p < .05). In addition to replicating an established inverse relationship between GMV in anxiety-associated brain structures and PTSD symptomatology, the present study extends those findings by being the first report of volumetric decreases in olfactory cortex that are inversely related to odor-elicited PTSD symptoms. Potential mechanisms underlying these findings are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alterations of the topological organization of abnormal regions or network-level structural aberrations are still poorly understood for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Herein, we investigated brain structural networks in recent-onset PTSD patients, all affected by the coalmine-flood disaster. Cortical networks were studied in recent onset PTSD patients (n = 15) and matched healthy controls (n = 25). Cortical networks were constructed by thresholding correlation matrices of 150 regions and quantified using graph theoretical approaches. Contributions of high-degree nodes, and regional and global network measures, including degree and betweenness, were studied. Compared with healthy controls, PTSD patients showed altered quantitative values in global network properties, characterized by shorter path length and higher clustering. Moreover, PTSD patients exhibited decreased connectivity in the right lingual gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Nodal centrality decreased predominantly in the occipital regions (lingual gyrus) and default-mode regions, while increased correlations and centralities were observed in the medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex. PTSD-related networks exhibited a less efficient organization and regional connectivity. According to these findings, we conclude that regional connections involving fear-processing and re-experiential-processing cortex may play a role in maintaining or adapting to PTSD pathology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study compared the difference in brain structure in 12 mine disaster survivors with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, 7 cases of improved post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and 14 controls who experienced the same mine disaster but did not suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, using the voxel-based morphometry method. The correlation between differences in brain structure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was also investigated. Results showed that the gray matter volume was the highest in the trauma control group, followed by the symptoms-improved group, and the lowest in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. Compared with the symptoms-improved group, the gray matter volume in the lingual gyrus of the right occipital lobe was reduced in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. Compared with the trauma control group, the gray matter volume in the right middle occipital gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus was reduced in the symptoms-improved group. Compared with the trauma control group, the gray matter volume in the left superior parietal lobule and right superior frontal gyrus was reduced in the chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group. The gray matter volume in the left superior parietal lobule was significantly positively correlated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory subscale score in the symptoms-improved group and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder group (r = 0.477, P = 0.039). Our findings indicate that (1) chronic post-traumatic stress disorder patients have gray matter structural damage in the prefrontal lobe, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe, (2) after post-traumatic stress, the disorder symptoms are improved and gray matter structural damage is reduced, but cannot recover to the trauma-control level, and (3) the superior parietal lobule is possibly associated with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder patients exhibit gray matter abnormalities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common in military populations and share numerous symptoms. Functional graph theory studies demonstrate altered small-world brain networks in mTBI and PTSD, but little is known about structural covariance networks or the potentially distinct topology of mTBI-PTSD comorbidity. The purpose of this study was to compare brain structural covariance networks in healthy active duty military service members (CON) to those with PTSD, mTBI, and mTBI-PTSD. Seventy-six service members (31 CON, 14 PTSD, 12 mTBI, 19 mTBI-PTSD) completed clinical questionnaires and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Cortical thickness-derived adjacency matrices were used to determine structural covariance network topologies. Pairwise comparisons for characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, modularity (global), closeness centrality (nodal), and local efficiency were made across a range of network densities (5-35%) using non-parametric permutation tests. All clinical groups showed greater levels of arousal, stress, anxiety, and depression compared with CON. Global network analysis revealed greater clustering and local efficiency in PTSD compared with CON, whereas nodal analysis indicated altered path lengths and closeness centrality in fronto-limbic areas with mTBI-PTSD. Global and nodal graph outcomes suggest distinct pathophysiological manifestations of mTBI, PTSD, and mTBI-PTSD in structural brain networks. Greater network segregation and nodal differences in fronto-limbic areas may be tied to emotional fluctuations.</p>

Recruited were 67 patients with PTSD and 78 adult survivors without PTSD 7-15 months after a devastating earthquake in western China. All participants underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 3-T imager to obtain anatomic images. Cortical thickness and volumes of 14 subcortical gray matter structures and five subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed with software. Statistical differences between patients with PTSD and healthy survivors were evaluated with a general linear model. Averaged data from the regions with volumetric or cortical thickness differences between groups were extracted in each individual to examine correlations between morphometric measures and clinical profiles. Results Patients with PTSD showed greater cortical thickness in the right superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and left precuneus (P < .05; Monte Carlo null-z simulation corrected) and showed reduced volume in the posterior portion of the corpus callosum (F = 6.167; P = .014) compared with healthy survivors of the earthquake. PTSD severity was positively correlated with cortical thickness in the left precuneus (r = 0.332; P = .008). The volumes of posterior corpus callosum were negatively correlated with PTSD ratings in all survivors (r = -0.210; P = .013) and with cortical thickness of the left precuneus in patients with PTSD (r = -0.302; P = .017). Conclusion Results indicate that patients with PTSD had alterations in both cerebral gray matter and white matter compared with individuals who experienced similar psychologic trauma from the same stressor. Importantly, early in the course of PTSD, gray matter changes were in the form of increased, not decreased, cortical thickness, which may have resulted from neuroinflammatory or other trophic process related to endocrine changes or functional compensation.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The amygdala is a core component in neurobiological models of stress and stress-related pathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While numerous studies have reported increased amygdala activity following traumatic stress exposure and in PTSD, the findings regarding amygdala volume have been mixed. One reason for these mixed findings may be that the amygdala has been considered as a homogenous entity, while it in fact consists of several nuclei with unique cellular and connectivity profiles. Here, we investigated amygdala nuclei volumes of the basolateral and the centrocorticomedial complex in relation to PTSD symptom severity in 47 young survivors from the 2011 Norwegian terror attack 24-36 months post-trauma. PTSD symptoms were assessed 4-5, 14-15 and 24-36 months following the trauma. We found that increased PTSD symptom severity 24-36 months post-trauma was associated with volumetric reductions of all basolateral as well as the central and the medial nuclei. However, only the lateral nucleus was associated with longitudinal symptom development, and mediated the association between 4-5 months and 24-36 months post-trauma symptoms. The results suggest that the amygdala nuclei may be differentially associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of PTSD symptom severity. As such, investigations of amygdala total volume may not provide an adequate index of the association between amygdala and stress-related mental illness.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a strong risk factor for development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult exposure to extreme adverse events. However, the neural underpinnings of this relationship are not well understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that severity of CM history is positively correlated with emotion-processing limbic and prefrontal brain activation/connectivity and negatively correlated with prefrontal gray matter volumes in women with PTSD due to intimate-partner violence (IPV-PTSD). Thirty-three women with IPV-PTSD underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing a facial emotion processing task. Multivariate regressions examined the relationship of CM to patterns of activation, connectivity, and gray matter volumes. CM severity was: (a) positively correlated with ventral ACC activation while processing angry faces; (b) negatively correlated with dorsal ACC and insula activation while processing fear and angry faces, arising from positive correlations with the shape-matching baseline; (c) positively correlated with limbic-prefrontal connectivity while processing fear faces but negatively correlated with amygdalo-insular connectivity while processing fear and angry; and (d) negatively correlated with prefrontal gray matter volumes. These results suggest CM exposure may account for variability in limbic/prefrontal brain function and prefrontal structure in adulthood PTSD and offer one potential mechanism through which CM confers risk to future development of PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We previously reported that hippocampal volume was associated with current, but not lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that like the hippocampus, the volumes of other brain regions previously implicated in PTSD, are also negatively related to current, but not lifetime PTSD symptom severity. One hundred ninety-one veterans underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 4T scanner. Seventy-five veterans were trauma unexposed, 43 were trauma exposed without PTSD, 39 were trauma exposed with current PTSD, and 34 were trauma exposed veterans with remitted PTSD. Hippocampal, amygdala, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, insula, and corpus callosum volumes, quantified with Freesurfer version 4.5, were analyzed by group using multivariate analysis of covariance. Veterans with PTSD had smaller hippocampal, caudal anterior cingulate, insula, and corpus callosum volumes than the unexposed controls (p≤0.009); smaller hippocampal, caudal anterior cingulate, insula (p≤0.009) and marginally smaller corpus callosum (p=0.06) than veterans with remitted PTSD; and smaller hippocampal and caudal anterior cingulate volumes than veterans without PTSD (p≤0.04). In contrast, there was no significant volume differences between veterans with remitted PTSD compared to those without PTSD or unexposed controls. The finding that current but not lifetime PTSD accounts for the volumes of multiple brain regions suggests that either smaller brain volume is a vulnerability factor that impedes recovery from PTSD or that recovery from PTSD is accompanied by a wide-spread restoration of brain tissue.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Both reduced hippocampal volume and cognitive alterations have been found in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this article was to examine the relationship between hippocampal volume, combat exposure, symptom severity, and memory performance in a sample of combat veterans with and without a history of PTSD. Subjects were 33 male veteran volunteers (16 PTSD+, 17 PTSD-) who underwent an MRI and neuropsychological testing with the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), a measure of declarative memory. Relationships between hippocampal volume (i.e., right + left hippocampal volume/whole brain volume) and performance on the CVLT were determined using partial correlational analysis controlled for age and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) vocabulary scores. Percent hippocampal volume for the entire sample was positively associated with several aspects of memory performance as reflected by the CVLT. In the PTSD+ group, CVLT performance was negatively correlated with lifetime, but not current CAPS symptoms. CVLT performance appears to be strongly correlated with hippocampal volume in a group of trauma survivors with and without PTSD. Insofar as CVLT performance in the PTSD group was negatively associated with worst episode, but not to current PTSD symptoms, memory performance in combat veterans may reflect some aspect of risk related to the magnitude of the psychological response to trauma, rather than current symptoms that may be interfering with cognitive performance. It will be of interest to study cognitive abilities that may relate to the likelihood of specific PTSD symptoms and to track changes in CVLT performance and hippocampal volume over time in persons with and without a history of trauma exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evidence suggests that olfactory bulb (OB), a key structure in odor processing, may also be involved in mechanisms of traumatic stress. In animals, chronic stress reduces OB plasticity, and olfactory bulbectomy results in stress-enhanced startle reflex and autonomic dysregulation. However, OB morphometry has not been adequately studied in the development of stress disorders following childhood trauma in humans. The researchers conducted a pilot study evaluating the relationships between OB volume, childhood trauma, and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of 16 HIV-positive individuals, 13 of whom were exposed to childhood trauma of 9 developed PTSD. Participants were recruited from a larger cohort of inner city-dwelling HIV-positive populations in Washington, DC. Mean OB volumes were significantly reduced when PTSD and non-PTSD groups were compared, p = .019, as well as when trauma-exposed PTSD-positive and trauma-exposed PTSD-negative groups were compared, p = .008. No significant difference was observed when trauma-exposed and nonexposed participants were compared. The association between PTSD and right OB volume remained strong p = 0.002 after adjusting for group differences in sex, age, depression, hippocampal volume, and total intracranial volume. Because this study is limited by small sample size, further elucidation of relationships between OB, trauma, and PTSD should be investigated in larger cross-sectional and prospective studies and in diverse cohorts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that afflicts many individuals, yet the neuropathological mechanisms that contribute to this disorder remain to be fully determined. Moreover, it is unclear how exposure to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a condition that is often comorbid with PTSD, particularly among military personnel, affects the clinical and neurological presentation of PTSD. To address these issues, the present study explores relationships between PTSD symptom severity and the microstructure of limbic and paralimbic gray matter brain regions, as well as the impact of mTBI comorbidity on these relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most brain imaging studies have showed smaller hippocampal volume in adults with chronic PTSD; however, some other studies have not replicated this finding. Most of these investigations included subjects with other psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depression or alcohol abuse. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in PTSD is generally high and this makes it difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle the contribution of other disorders to hippocampal volume. Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to compare hippocampal volumes of healthy subjects and drug-naïve patients with PTSD caused by different types of mixed civilian traumas (i.e. car accident, physical abuse, sudden death of a family member, assault or robbery, natural disaster and traumatic abortion) and without comorbidity conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure the hippocampi, total cerebrum, gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in 34 patients with single diagnosis of PTSD, and 34 case-matched non-PTSD comparison subjects. The patients with single diagnosis of PTSD had an 11.8% smaller left hippocampus (p<0.001) and an 8.7% smaller right hippocampus (p=0.003) than the healthy controls. The results were controlled for the total brain volume and for gray matter volumes. Subjects with PTSD also displayed lower overall gray matter volume (p=0.006). There were no significant correlations between hippocampal volumes and illness duration or severity of PTSD. The findings indicate the presence of smaller hippocampal volumes in drug-naïve patients with single diagnosis of PTSD, compared with healthy subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients experience symptoms which implicate dysfunction of emotional memory circuits, and possible damage of the amygdala. Laterality differences in activity of the amygdala have been reported in PTSD patients, with presumed adaptive plasticity in the hippocampus and the amygdala. The aim of this study was to investigate possible interhemispheric differences of amygdalar volume in chronic PTSD patients, with calculation of right-to-left volume ratios. Bilateral magnetic resonance (MR) volumetry was applied in 11 chronic PTSD patients. The mean right amygdalar volume of our patients was significantly smaller than the left one (p = 0.031), with the right-to-left volume ratio of 0.96 +/- 0.06. This tendency towards smaller right amygdala may be an acquired effect as a result of stress-induced plasticity, however we can not exclude the possibility of a predisposing condition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) focused primarily on measuring of small brain structure volume or regional brain volume changes. There were rare reports investigating cortical thickness alterations in recent onset PTSD. Recent advances in computational analysis made it possible to measure cortical thickness in a fully automatic way, along with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) that enables an exploration of global structural changes throughout the brain by applying statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to high-resolution MRI. In this paper, Laplacian method was utilized to estimate cortical thickness after automatic segmentation of gray matter from MR images under SPM. Then thickness maps were analyzed by SPM8. Comparison between 10 survivors from a mining disaster with recent onset PTSD and 10 survivors without PTSD from the same trauma indicates cortical thinning in the left parietal lobe, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. The regional cortical thickness of the right inferior frontal gyrus showed a significant negative correlation with the CAPS score in the patients with PTSD. Our study suggests that shape-related cortical thickness analysis may be more sensitive than volumetric analysis to subtle alteration at early stage of PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many people exposed to torture later suffer from torture-related post-traumatic stress disorder (TR-PTSD). The aim of this study was to analyze the morphologic and functional brain changes in patients with TR-PTSD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). This study evaluated 19 subjects. Thirteen subcortical brain structures were evaluated using FSL software. On the T1-weighted images, normalized brain volumes were measured using SIENAX software. The study compared the volume of the brain and 13 subcortical structures in 9 patients suffering from TR-PTSD after torture and 10 healthy volunteers (HV). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed in the transverse plane. In addition, the 18F-FDG PET data were evaluated to identify the activity of the elected regions. The mean left hippocampal volume for the TR-PTSD group was significantly lower than in the HV group (post hoc test (Bonferroni) P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the gray matter volume of the patients with TR-PTSD and the HV group (post hoc test (Bonferroni) P < 0.001). The TR-PTSD group showed low significant expansion of the ventricles in contrast to the HV group (post hoc test (Bonferroni) P < 0.001). Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed significant differences in the right frontal lobe and the left occipital lobe between the TR-PTSD and HV group (post hoc test (Bonferroni) P < 0.001). Moderate hypometabolism was noted in the occipital lobe in 6 of the 9 patients with TR-PTSD, in the temporal lobe in 1 of the 9 patients, and in the caudate nucleus in 5 of the 9 patients. In 2 cases, additional hypometabolism was observed in the posterior cingulate cortex and in the parietal and frontal lobes. The findings from this study show that TR-PTSD might have a deleterious influence on a set of specific brain structures. This study also demonstrated that PET combined with MRI is sensitive in detecting possible metabolic and structural brain changes in TR-PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been related to brain alterations in female survivors. Nonetheless, few studies have used an exploratory approach, focusing on brain regions that are traditionally studied in other populations with post-traumatic stress. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), strangulation, and childhood trauma are highly prevalent among this population, and have also been associated with brain alterations and functional deterioration. As such, it is difficult to determine how different brain regions are affected by the complex interplay of these factors in female survivors. The aim of this study is to assess (a) brain alterations in female survivors of IPV as compared to non-victim females and (b) the potential causal mechanisms associated with such alterations. We hypothesized that structural brain differences would be found between female survivors of IPV and non-victims, and that these differences would be related to IPV-related TBI, strangulation, IPV severity, depression, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, and childhood adverse experiences. A total of 27 non-victims and 28 survivors completed structural magnetic resonance imaging and questionnaires to measure the potential causal mechanisms for brain alterations. Structural brain differences were found between groups, principally in volumetric analyses. The brain regions in which between-group differences were found were related to attempted strangulation, IPV-related TBI, severity of IPV, adverse childhood experiences, and post-traumatic stress. These results demonstrate that a wider range of brain regions may be impacted by IPV and that various factors are implicated in the structural brain alterations found in female survivors. This study demonstrates the importance of post-traumatic stress, childhood and adult trauma, and physical violence in assessing brain alterations in IPV survivors. Further, it serves as a critical first step in assessing an extensive list of potential causal mechanisms for structural brain alterations, using a more comprehensive a whole-brain structural analysis of IPV female victims, a largely understudied and vulnerable population.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of this work was to analyze asymmetry of hippocampal formation in PTSD patients. The objects of the analysis were 10 MRI scans of patients with PTSD with established cognitive function damage. MRI scans were obtained using MAGNET IMPACT SIEMENS 1,0 TESLA in T1 and T2 relaxation. The measurement of hippocampal formation dimensions, and comparisons between the right and the left side were done using evaluate - distance program on the MRI instrument of the Institute of Radiology at Sarajevo Clinics Center. We tested 20 patients with PTSD 49,9 years of average age with standard deviation of 4,62 years. Based on the analysis of our results regarding the size of hippocampal formation in all the three projections (axial, coronal and sagital), in the group of patients with PTSD, we can the make the following observations: 1. In axial slice the length of hippocampal formation measured on the left and right side is significantly asymmetric in all patients. In the sagital slice, the hippocampal formation measured on the left side is in many cases longer than in the right - 50 %. In coronal slice no significant differences were found in the proportion of patients according to symmetry/asymmetry of hippocampal formation width on the left and right. 2. The difference in average size of hippocampal formation between the left and right side measured in axial and coronal slices is not statistically significant, but it is significant in sagitall slice. So, the results of this new research, showed smaller hippocampal dimensions in PTSD as measured using MRI. We have to be careful about what projection we are refusing to as being watched hippocampal formation because the results will depend on that. We suggest that future studies be done in more projections because of the importance of statistically significant conclusions. MRI - volumetric measurements have their value.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops in some people following trauma exposure. Trauma and PTSD have been associated with accelerated cellular aging. This study evaluated the effect of trauma and PTSD on accelerated GrimAge, an epigenetic predictor of lifespan, in traumatized civilians. This study included 218 individuals with current PTSD, 427 trauma-exposed controls without any history of PTSD and 209 subjects with lifetime PTSD history who are not categorized as current PTSD cases. The Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were used to measure lifetime trauma burden and PTSD, respectively. DNA from whole blood was interrogated using the MethylationEPIC or HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. GrimAge estimates were calculated using the methylation age calculator. Cortical thickness of 69 female subjects was assessed by using T1-weighted structural MRI images. Associations between trauma exposure, PTSD, cortical thickness, and GrimAge acceleration were tested with multiple regression models. Lifetime trauma burden (p = 0.03), current PTSD (p = 0.02) and lifetime PTSD (p = 0.005) were associated with GrimAge acceleration, indicative of a shorter predicted lifespan. The association with lifetime PTSD was replicated in an independent cohort (p = 0.04). In the MRI sub sample, GrimAge acceleration also associated with cortical atrophy in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (p</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Combat-exposed Veterans are at increased risk for developing psychological distress, mood disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Trauma and mood disorders have been linked to alterations in brain volume, function, and connectivity. However, far less is known about the effects of combat exposure on brain health. The present study examined the relationship between severity of combat exposure and cortical thickness. Post-9/11 Veterans (N = 337; 80% male) were assessed with structural neuroimaging and clinically for combat exposure, depressive symptoms, prior head injury, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Vertex-wide cortical thickness was estimated using FreeSurfer autosegmentation. FreeSurfer's Qdec was used to examine relationship between combat exposure, PTSD, and prior head injuries on cortical thickness (Monte Carlo corrected for multiple comparisons, vertex-wise cluster threshold of 1.3, p < 0.01). Covariates included age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, nonmilitary trauma, alcohol use, and prior head injury. Higher combat exposure uniquely related to lower cortical thickness in the left prefrontal lobe and increased cortical thickness in the left middle and inferior temporal lobe; whereas PTSD negatively related to cortical thickness in the right fusiform. Head injuries related to increased cortical thickness in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex. Combat exposure uniquely contributes to lower cortical thickness in regions implicated in executive functioning, attention, and memory after accounting for the effects of PTSD and prior head injury. Our results highlight the importance of examining effects of stress and trauma exposure on neural health in addition to the circumscribed effects of specific syndromal pathology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Methylation of the SKA2 (spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2) gene has recently been identified as a promising biomarker of suicide risk. Based on this finding, we examined associations between SKA2 methylation, cortical thickness and psychiatric phenotypes linked to suicide in trauma-exposed veterans. About 200 trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic veterans of the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (91% male) underwent clinical assessment and had blood drawn for genotyping and methylation analysis. Of all, 145 participants also had neuroimaging data available. Based on previous research, we examined DNA methylation at the cytosine-guanine locus cg13989295 as well as DNA methylation adjusted for genotype at the methylation-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7208505) in relationship to whole-brain cortical thickness, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses identified three clusters in prefrontal cortex that were associated with genotype-adjusted SKA2 DNA methylation (methylation(adj)). Specifically, DNA methylation(adj) was associated with bilateral reductions of cortical thickness in frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus, and similar effects were found in the right orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with SKA2 DNA methylation(adj) and negatively correlated with cortical thickness in these regions. Mediation analyses showed a significant indirect effect of PTSD on cortical thickness via SKA2 methylation status. Results suggest that DNA methylation(adj) of SKA2 in blood indexes stress-related psychiatric phenotypes and neurobiology, pointing to its potential value as a biomarker of stress exposure and susceptibility.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Investigating hippocampal subfields may provide new and important insights into the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study has examined the hippocampal subfield volume changes in parents with or without PTSD who had lost their only child and could no longer conceive in China. Fifty-seven parents with PTSD (PTSD+), 11 trauma-exposed parents without PTSD (PTSD-), and 39 non-traumatized controls were recruited to examine the hippocampal subfield volumes using magnetic resonance imaging. Correlations of the volumes with the time since trauma and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores were investigated in the PTSD+ group. The volumes of the bilateral cornu ammonis (CA) 2-3, CA4-dentate gyrus (DG), and left subiculum were significantly smaller in the PTSD+ and PTSD- groups than in the controls, but there were no significant differences between the PTSD+ and PTSD- groups. Additionally, the left CA2-3 and CA4-DG volumes reduced more than those on the right side in the PTSD+ and PTSD- groups. The subfield volumes were not related to the time since trauma and the CAPS scores in the PTSD+ group. In conclusion, hippocampal subfield volumes decreased in parents who lost their only child with or without PTSD, and the volumetric reduction may be independent of PTSD and trauma-related. Moreover, the hippocampal volume deficits showed laterality that the left side was affected more than the right, and the hippocampal subfields may show differential vulnerabilities to trauma/PTSD, with the CA2-3 and CA4-DG subfields more sensitive than others.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structural neuroimaging studies in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused primarily on structural alterations in the medial temporal lobe, and only a few have examined grey matter reductions in the cortex. Recent advances in computational analysis provide new opportunities to use semi-automatic techniques to determine cortical thickness, but these techniques have not yet been applied in PTSD. Twenty-five male veterans with PTSD and twenty-five male veterans without PTSD matched for age, year and region of deployment were recruited. All the subjects were scanned using MRI. Subjects' brains were aligned using cortex-based alignment in a region of interest based approach. Individual cortical thickness maps were calculated from the MR images. Regions of interest examined included the bilateral superior frontal gyri, bilateral middle frontal gyri, bilateral inferior frontal gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri, and bilateral middle temporal gyri. In a large number of patients and controls, IQ scores and memory scores were also obtained. Individual cortical thickness maps were calculated from the MR images. Veterans with PTSD revealed reduced cortical thickness in the bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior temporal gyrus. Veterans with PTSD performed significantly worse on memory measures compared to control veterans. Cortical thickness correlated with memory measures in the veterans without PTSD, but not in the veterans with PTSD. Cortical thinning in these regions may thus correspond to functional abnormalities observed in patients with PTSD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trauma-related disorders of affect and cognition (TRACs) are associated with a high degree of diagnostic comorbidity, which may suggest that these disorders share a set of underlying neural mechanisms. TRACs are characterized by aberrations in functional and structural circuits subserving verbal memory and affective anticipation. Yet, it remains unknown how the neural circuitry underlying these multiple mechanisms contribute to TRACs. Here, in a sample of 47 combat Veterans, we measured affective anticipation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), verbal memory with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and grey matter volume with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). Using a voxel-based multimodal canonical correlation analysis (mCCA), the set of neural measures were statistically integrated, or fused, with a set of TRAC symptom measures including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), posttraumatic stress, and depression severity. The first canonical correlation pair revealed neural convergence in clusters encompassing the middle frontal gyrus and supplemental motor area, regions implicated in top-down cognitive control and affect regulation. These results highlight the potential of leveraging multivariate neuroimaging analysis for linking neurobiological mechanisms associated with TRACs, paving the way for transdiagnostic biomarkers and targets for treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. It can be difficult to discern the symptoms of PTSD and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities focus on different aspects, which may provide complementary information for PTSD discrimination. However, none of the published studies assessed the diagnostic potential of multimodal MRI in identifying individuals with and without PTSD. In the current study, we investigated whether the complementary information conveyed by multimodal MRI scans could be combined to improve PTSD classification performance. Structural and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans were conducted on 17 PTSD patients, 20 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (TEC) and 20 non-traumatized healthy controls (HC). Gray matter volume (GMV), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and regional homogeneity were extracted as classification features, and in order to integrate the information of structural and functional MRI data, the extracted features were combined by a multi-kernel combination strategy. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to distinguish the subjects at individual level. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. In the pairwise comparison of PTSD, TEC, and HC groups, classification accuracies obtained by the proposed approach were 2.70, 2.50, and 2.71% higher than the best single feature way, with the accuracies of 89.19, 90.00, and 67.57% for PTSD vs. HC, TEC vs. HC, and PTSD vs. TEC respectively. The proposed approach could improve PTSD identification at individual level. Additionally, it provides preliminary support to develop the multimodal MRI method as a clinical diagnostic aid.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Differences in structural white and gray matter in survivors of traumatic experiences have been related to the development and maintenance of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, there are very few studies on diffusion tensor imaging and region based morphometry comparing patients with PTSD to two control groups, namely healthy individuals with or without trauma experience. It is also unknown if differences in white and gray matter are associated. In this cross-sectional study, we examined white- and gray matter differences between 44 patients with PTSD, 49 trauma control and 61 healthy control subjects. We compared the groups applying Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) for a whole brain white matter analysis as well as region of interest analyses for white and gray matter. First, trauma control subjects in comparison to patients with PTSD and healthy control subjects showed significantly a) higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus than patients with PTSD, b) higher FA in the left inferior fronto-occipital-, right inferior- and right superior longitudinal fasciculi, c) higher FA in the forceps minor and d) higher volume of the left and right anterior insulae. Second, we show significant correlations between the FA in the forceps minor and the gray matter volume in the left and right anterior insulae. Third, the mean FA value in the forceps minor correlated negatively with symptom severity of PTSD and depression as well as trait anxiety, whereas the gray matter volume in the left anterior insula correlated negatively with symptom severity in PTSD. Our findings underline the importance of brain structures critically involved in emotion regulation and salience mapping. While previous studies associated these processes primarily to functional and task-based differences in brain activity, we argue that morphometrical white and gray matter differences could serve as targets in neuroscientifically-informed prevention and treatment interventions for PTSD.</p>
