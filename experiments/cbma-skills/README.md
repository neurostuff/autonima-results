# cbma-skills

An experiment. Can a general-purpose coding agent (Claude Code, Codex) run a
coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analysis end to end, with only a set of skills
and no specialized LLM pipeline?

The package holds no LLM client and needs no API key. The agent does every
judgment itself, through subagents:
- abstract screening
- full-text screening
- splitting coordinate tables into analyses
- selecting analyses for each target

A few small standard-library scripts do the bookkeeping that an agent should not do
from memory:
- searching PubMed completely
- normalizing full texts
- validating and recording decisions
- checking extracted coordinates against their tables
- exporting NiMADS

This package does not import or wrap autonima. It now lives in autonima-results,
next to the benchmark data and autonima's runs that it is scored against, and it is
meant to move to its own repository.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the hypothesis, the benchmark protocol and the MCP
decision.

## Skills

| Skill | Role |
|---|---|
| [`cbma-review`](skills/cbma-review/SKILL.md) | orchestrator: stage order, batching protocol, audit checklist; holds the ledger |
| [`pubmed-search`](skills/pubmed-search/SKILL.md) | complete, de-duplicated PubMed search via E-utilities |
| [`fulltext-sources`](skills/fulltext-sources/SKILL.md) | PMC open access plus any local folders of pre-downloaded articles |
| [`screen-studies`](skills/screen-studies/SKILL.md) | abstract and full-text screening against numbered criteria |
| [`extract-coordinates`](skills/extract-coordinates/SKILL.md) | table → analyses → points, using autonima's analysis-boundary rules |
| [`select-analyses`](skills/select-analyses/SKILL.md) | analysis × target inclusion decisions |
| [`cbma-nimare`](skills/cbma-nimare/SKILL.md) | NiMADS export and NiMARE meta-analysis |

## Install

The skills are plain folders, and they are installed as a set because the
orchestrator refers to the others by relative path.

```bash
# Claude Code: project-level (inside the folder where you will run reviews) or user-level
./install.sh /path/to/reviews-workspace          # links into .claude/skills and .agents/skills
# or by hand:
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && ln -s "$PWD"/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

- **Codex:** it reads skills from its own skills directory. `install.sh` also links
  them into `.agents/skills`, but check the Codex version you use for the current
  location.
- **Dependencies:** `pip install pyyaml` for every stage, plus `pip install nimare`
  for the meta-analysis stage only.
- **Network:** outbound access to `eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` for search and PMC.

## Use

In the agent, from a workspace containing a review folder:

> Run the cbma-review skill on ./wm_schizophrenia. Pilot abstract screening on 50 records first.

The orchestrator walks the stages. The loop at every judged stage is:

```bash
python SKILLS/cbma-review/scripts/ledger.py batches REVIEW --stage abstract --size 25
#   one subagent per batch file, each following the stage skill
python SKILLS/cbma-review/scripts/ledger.py ingest  REVIEW --stage abstract --agent "claude-code/<model>"
python SKILLS/cbma-review/scripts/ledger.py status  REVIEW
```

If the harness can't spawn subagents, or to run a large stage headless,
`skills/cbma-review/scripts/run_batches.sh` runs each batch in a fresh
`claude -p` or `codex exec` session.

## What the scripts enforce

These are the lessons from autonima's issue tracker and code review, made
mechanical:

| Rule | Autonima failure it prevents |
|---|---|
| esearch windows split past 9,999; retrieved must equal reported | silent truncation at 10k (#53) |
| every abstract section, full titles, the article's own DOI, string PMIDs | truncated abstracts and titles, wrong DOIs, integer PMIDs giving 0 studies (#56) |
| failures are never decisions; rejected output stays pending and is retried | failed screenings cached forever |
| unavailable ≠ excluded, reported separately in PRISMA | retrieval failures counted as exclusions |
| a missing selection decision is never exported as `false` | missing annotations exported as "exclude" |
| every extracted xyz must appear in its table row, or the point is dropped | sign errors and invented foci reaching the meta-analysis |
| duplicate tables flagged at normalization | double-weighted studies (#60) |
| reference lists removed from full text | bibliography sent to the model (#67) |
| unknown `review.yaml` keys are errors | typos silently ignored (#58) |
| criteria IDs numbered per stage; decisions keyed on hashes of criteria, skill text and input | renumbered IDs reusing stale decisions; hand-bumped prompt versions |
| full-text evidence quotes checked against the text | ungrounded reasons (#38) |

## Tests

From the autonima-results root:

```bash
pip install pytest pyyaml
pytest experiments/cbma-skills/tests
```

The tests run offline against fixtures. They cover PubMed parsing, date-window
splitting, retries, JATS and HTML normalization, point verification, and one review
through every stage, with fake subagent output.
